european pioneer in monitoring and optimization of wind farms presentation deck sereema pitch 2 the ambition to be the benchmark solution for optimizing the production of wind farms in europe the solution first to collect its own data in a complex environment and monitor this data and the data generated natively by the turbines second to make sense of large amounts of data to reveal the hidden potential and finally to give direct corrective actions to be taken on the field sereema does all three the challenge a potential gain of 1 million per year for a fleet of 100 turbines and avoiding the emission of 4 000 tco2eq the market 105 000 turbines in europe and 350 000 worldwide growth of 15 expected in the next five years achievements to date arr of 1 1 million in 2022 23 customers 60 exported 400 turbines continuously monitored sereema 3 paradigm shift the sale of renewable electricity is less and less subsidized and subject to market forces more volatile by nature wind farm owners have a greater responsibility to monitor the performance and yield of their assets findings it is estimated that the lack of optimization causes green producers to lose 1 m a year for a 100 machine park the problem for wind asset owners no available solution at a large scale 100 turbines - either one has to involve experts on the field who are too expensive to use - or one relies on the analysis of the data provided by the turbines scada data which is unaccurate and incomplete for performance monitoring optimization of operating wind farms is key in a market that has become more volatile by assuming price risk developers are incentivised to deploy efficiently and drive down project costs developers like different contract options as mandatory cfds reduce their options to optimise their cash flows zachmann said bruegel think tank sereema the windfit technology solution 4sereema salgorithmson the cloud on-board sensor and data acquisition box capable of operating effectively in complex conditions turbulence embedded edge processing compatible with all brands of turbines offshore proof automated processing chain to turn high frequency dataflow sereema s own data scada data via api into real time diagnosis fully integrated designed entirely in-house allow the processing of 30 times more data than those provided by the turbine manufacturer the dashboards provide automatic access to fleet supervision as well as ready-to-use turbine diagnostics alerts are also sent directly to the operating teams increase margins by optimizing performance on a large scale windfitdata boxdashboard alertsscada data scada data produced directly by the wind turbines sereema scada data versus windfit data scada data generated by the wind turbines and controlled by the turbine manufacturer do not require additional sensors or installations on the wind turbine designed to monitor the good functioning of the machine but not for performance monitoring lacks precision poor resolution no guarantee of reliability sometimes with random availability and therefore not adapted to new operating requirements 5 windfit data produced by the 7 sensors present on sereema s box independent of the wind turbine manufacturer specifically designed for diagnostics and performance analysis high resolution data which allows to continuously update the results benefits from high precision measurements examples of information that is essential but impossible to obtain with scada data alone power curve corrected by air density yet standard method of measuring the performance of a wind turbine rotor imbalance detection 1 3 of all wind turbines have this type of problem sereema market opportunity 350 000 turbines worldwide wind turbines in operation 6 105 000 turbines europe global wind power 15 average annual growth from 2023 to 2027 gwec-2023 europe installation of 4 000 to 7 000 wind turbines per year over the same period wind europe 2023 sereema already has customers in most major european countries germany spain france italy portugal greece ireland austria our challenge is to expand this presence in order to become the leader in wind data in europe sereema the offers functions investors renewable players ipp large scale companies diagnosis detection of the defects of the turbine rotor power orientation evaluation of losses and gains alerts fleet optimization continuous monitoring of performance on a park-wide basis automated identification of the farms and machines at stake reports the product o ffer 7 windfit is already used by the three major categories of wind farm owners despite not having the same needs independent power producers ipps investment funds large industrial companies utilities majors new offer -april 2023 now the offer has two options to better respond to our customer needs still using the same technology sereema 8 sereema 3 years of estimated advance diagnostic offer subscription formula per box responds to the need to deal with undetectable anomalies without acquiring additional data in-depth processing adapted to the advanced operating methods implemented by owners with strong in- house technical skills large industrial companies and some ipps allows for successive diagnostic campaigns that last about 6 months per wind turbine degressive price from 4000 year to 2000 year depending on the number and duration of subscriptions fleet optimization offer subscription formula per turbine responds to the need for continuous performance monitoring control on a fleet scale diagnostics when needed adapted to players with little internal technical skills software functionalities based on scada data optimization campaigns with installation of a box for 12 months on each wind turbine the number of boxes made available is 1 3 of the fleet to be monitored average target price of 1000 turbine the revenue model 8 subscription from 6 months to 3 years includes access to the platform and the supply of boxes these are not sold -

involving experts on the field is too expensive to use on a large scale - digital solutions based on scada data facilitate supervision 1 and analysis 2 but the low quality of the data and the lack of precision of these tools do not allow to address point 3 sereema believes it is 3 years ahead of the competition with a strong potential moving forward thanks to its acquired know-how and independent database sereema date metrics 10 1 1m arr 60 export 400 subscriptions 23 clients sereema the impact in numbers more than 5 000 t co eq avoided an estimated 30 gwh of production gain the alerts produced led to nearly 400 interventions in the field up to 9 annual production gains on a single wind turbine 11 sereema market traction 12 38 subscriptions at end of q1 2023 yoy notable extension finerge 20 subscriptions 3 new customer clearvise arr per client at the end of q1 46 k 53 yoy commercial pipe at 12 months 25 players representing 2 2 m of arr excerpt from la tribune -
