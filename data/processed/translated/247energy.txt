for private placement followed by direct listing on euronext 247 energy is a disruptive energy solution provider in the process of building a fully robotized giga factory to produce its state-of-the-art storage solutions based on both proprietary and licensed ip that helps combat climate change and reduces co2 emissions whilst offering the most cost-effective solution to multiple industries and enabling the growing market of smart-grids 247 s technology outperforms all existing solutions whilst generating sustainable cash flows leading to exponential value creation for all stakeholders and impact the world for the better a unique investment opportunity 247 energy was incorporated in 2017 and is headquartered in antwerp belgium the mission is to go for zero co2 a world that runs 100 on decentralized energy production and storage of renewable energy the goal is to design and produce innovative sustainable safe long lasting energy production and storage solutions a disruptive energy solution a robotized eu giga-factory 100 000 m location in belgium at phase 1 turnover of 360m and profit of 100m flexible assembly lines can produce different form- factors of energy storage modules modular energy solutions for all markets full support of regional national governments job creation of 145 people from 1 to 16 gw production capacity p hase 1 1gw 23 24 25 26 27 production capacity 2gw production capacity phase 2 4gw production capacity 8gw production capacity phase 3 16gw based on lng hydrogen gas-to- energy allows an energy production of 0 5-1 5 mw or multiples advantages can produce energy anytime can be installed in a day several units can be combined for on off grid applications cheaper than the national grid in many countries made in europe based on supercapacitors with an intelligent software layer the energy storage solution is a unique in its features charges discharges up to 20x faster than legacy batteries non-flammable non-explosive a 45 years lifetime 1 000 000 cycles compared to 5-7 years for lithium-ion batteries non-chemical and fully electric no harm-full metals no polluting production methods not temperature sensitive no degradation over time regardless usage made in europe mobile energy production plants disruptive non-chemical energy storage solutions state-of-the-art solutions proprietary licensed ip mobile energy production plants disruptive non-chemical energy storage solutions today 247 containerized powerplant based on lng is patented and under extension in 69 countries patent w02019092224a1 tomorrow 247 is working on replacing lng with h2 the patent contains a path towards hydrogen and or methane for co2 free energy production today 247 uses unique licensed hypersensitive ip on supercapacitor technology tomorrow 247 works with universities on proprietary ip to increase energy density of super-capacitor technology even further solve renewable energy issue the problem wind solar energy plants do not deliver energy continuously and are not flexible grid connections in some areas are unstable or simply not able to deliver the energy needed the growth of electric vehicles ships needing shore-power etc will further increase the demand energy production shortage because of transition away from nuclear and solar wind not able to provide base-load energy production capacity classical batteries chemical composition is not aligned with the green eco revolution raw materials lithium cobalt will not be able to meet market demand and need polluting production methods both lithium cobalt are sold at highest price in 10 years and the battery race has just begun 247 energy production units can produce energy during shortage the only element needed is lng or h2 no matter the environmental or weather conditions in h2 modus no co2 emissions 247 energy storage can store the energy in excess produced by renewables in order to use it when it is needed 247 systems require no polluting rare metals mining like cobalt lithium the 2 solutions cost-effective safe reliable 247 energy solution is nonflammable and non explosive which is a huge advantage towards industrial and residential energy storage and other sectors in need of solutions safer than lithium-ion clients such as kursaal oostende rely on a 247 solution for 100 of their energy production since 2019 industries are pressured to reduce their co2 footprint 247 helps them meet this challenge safely european industries are in urgent need of energy storage solutions cfr production ramp-up reliable

global automotive batteries 70b eur 2027 cagr 6 6 uk alone counts for 546 grid battery projects for a total of 16gw enabler of smart-grids 247 enables smart-grids with 2 vital and complementary solutions energy production and storage infrastructure that is always on even with renewable resources decentralized energy production and smaller smart- grids are finally possible anywhere in the world the energy storage solution allows to stock wind and solar energy when it is produced in excess the energy production solution feeds power into the grid when renewables cannot produce the energy needed technology that outperforms charges 20x faster than lithium-ion lifespan of 1 000 000 cycles 45 years nonflammable non-explosive suited for atex no chemicals no rare metals shock resistant vibration proof 247-maintenance free energy storage outperforms legacy batteries produced in different formfactors temperature resistant -35 c to 65 c no degradation over time regardless of usage
