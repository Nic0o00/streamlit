The energy of the waves with the Hace Hace Houlomomotor Electrics The Cheapest Decarbon Energy in the world Green energy production A colossal need for the next 30 years growing needs in global growth and economic growth Electricity The capacities of electrical installations will triple here 2050 from 8000 GW to 24000 GW or 500 GW An emergency climatic requiring the energy production sector. CO2 emissions in the objective world of going to 85 to 90 of renewables in the energy mix by 2050 geostrategic issues Search for energy autonomy important factor of sovereignty and independence very insufficient production capacity of renewable electricity in the world only 36 of electricity production units use renewable energy global market exceeding 300 billion dollars per year Electricity production excluding hydrogen HACE HACE Solution of unique green electricity on the cheapest market that can be cheaper that respectful of the simple environment to install and keep non-intermittent reliable and pilotable hace solution for the cheapest green electricity production and the least carbonated with the lowest electricity production less than 20 MWh on large installations the lowest carbon footprints less than 1 g Possibility of producing green hydrogen at less than 1 kg production of non-intermittent green electricity reliable and controllable charging factor of 50 to 90 according to site much higher than all the other insubmersible EMR resists bad weather and extreme events cyclone waves shifted modular allowing to dimension the installation according to the needs of 1mw to 1GW per installation site works with all chaotic waves 10 cm and up to 30 m high hace hace green electricity production easy to install and maintain Sonshore offshore and nearshore simple and quick to set up 1 to 3 days per mw low-tech with simple maintenance type plug-and-play-to-play solution for the production of green electricity respectful of the environment and the biodiversity No obstruction Water light and non -invasive installation no impact on ecosystems Coastal protection by disorganization of zero concrete waves Installation by anchors fully removable and recyclable at 95
