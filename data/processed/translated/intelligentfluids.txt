intelligent fluids eliminates the toxicity of the cleaning process by replacing the use of chemicals for a physical process that detaches the dirt from the surfaces while improving the overall efficiency of the production process making it substrate 4 rinse deactivate intelligent fluid 1 penetration and fragmentation water 2 undercut 3 lift-off physical cleaning how do we do it instead of aggressive chemical dissolving intelligent fluids use a physical process for the cleaning of surfaces that consists of removing layers smoothly through physical effects without the use of harmful chemicals intelligent fluids eliminates the toxicity of industrial cleaning processes the patented technology of intelligent fluids combines gentle ingredients to tailor-made phase fluids that remove organic contaminants effectively and gently by a molecular teamwork like a micro-earthquake this groundbreaking impact chemistry is able to penetrate fragment and finally lift-off even persistent
