members partners investors the information shared in this document is proprietary and strictly confidential and should not be shared without prior consent in writing by maana electric sa strategies plans and forecasts exposed hereafter may rapidly change as market conditions and business opportunities may evolve in the future 2 confidential proprietary our purpose powering human ambition in the solar system 3 1 build inexpensive solar capacity in deserts on earth 2 build solar capacity on the moon 3 build solar capacity on mars and other celestial objects step confidential proprietary the future producing solar power on the moon 4 confidential proprietary the present turning sand into solar panels on earth confidential proprietary 5 solar energy-fighting climate change 6 confidential proprietary even a 1 mw solar power plant can cut down carbon emissions by almost 1000 tonnes per annum which is equivalent to planting about 5000 trees every year yet solar energy is underused 7 confidential proprietary in 1h the sun gives the earth the same amount of energy as that consumed by all of humanity in 1 year yet in some countries bathed by the sun you see almost no solar panels untapped abundance of desert land and sand 8 confidential proprietary 9 the problem strong focus on price with little product innovation means margins are tiny confidential proprietary price of photovoltaics pv greenhouse gasses are produced in todays pv supply chain emissions our solution automated transportable production facilities which build solar panels - using only in-situ materials and electricity as inputs confidential proprietary 10 10 the terrabox sand electricity solar panel solar capacity produced per year 10mw expected lifetime 10 years 100mw pv capacity over lifetime the value proposition confidential proprietary 11 10x less expensive than any current solar panel low cost no co2 emissions and no toxic material use from production process unheard of in today s industry

traditional industry comes from using low value sands our own electricity production and supply chains shortcuts local production means maana can circumvent tariffs which typically affect competition i e 70 tariff in usa 50 in eu mineral mining reduction purification wafer production solar cell production solar panel assembly distribution installation months to years process time this is a simplified representation confidential proprietary broader impact confidential proprietary 14 economic impact reduction of the pv solar energy cost thanks to the much lower cost of the solar panel produced with terrrabox widening of potential installation sites for solar parks due to the removal of logistic constraints existing nowadays especially in remote desertic areas societal impact foster renewables by reducing their prices wealth creation in depressed areas also promoting the local employment reduction of the reliance on fossil fuels and political conflicts related to oil reserves environmental impact reduction of co2 emissions through the use of a green and never-failing source of energy reduction of the emissions related to the transport of conventional solar panels from the factory usually in china to the installation sites zero emissions during the whole process in terrabox except during the commissioning and first production period reduction and subsequent elimination of the reliance on carbon-based fuels ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy build resilient infrastructure p romote sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts reduction of greenhouse gases ghg in gigatons per year confidential proprietary 15 the reduction of ghg cannot be compared only to conventional solar panels because this does not take into account the potential for additional reduction in ghg due to switching from non renewable to maana electric technology the comparison is best made to different real energy mixes of countries in which maana electric may operate maana electric 0 00 solar 0 07 spain 0 43 luxembourg 0 54 eu 0 59

maana compared to other energy mixes by 2032 maana will produce enough panels with its 1200 terraboxes to offset 860 megatons of co2 equivalent per year when compared to the us current energy mix maana s impact would be most significant in countries like south africa and australia where coal is dominant timeline 16 confidential proprietary maana creation 2018 2019 2020 validation of the sub-

assembling of the panels working see picture ip technology confidential proprietary 18 maana electric does not pursue a patent strategy due to the geographic location of the majority of competition being in china for this reason it does not share information about its technology without an nda however maana has identified at least 10 technologies within its production process which could be patented mainly in the field of separation beneficiation metals refining materials photovoltaics manufacturing solar panel integration the esa considers maana s technology as highly promising for isru metal oxygen production on the moon which has resulted in continued financial support isru in situ resource utilization space isru technologies material science earth automated industry 4 0 processes
