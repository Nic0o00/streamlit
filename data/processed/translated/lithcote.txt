ceramic by its action it reduces the use of chemical biocides and helps to preserve biodiversity and the planet against covid-19 its immediate effect has been demonstrated in a university laboratory 6 the positively charged quats on the surface attracts negative charges from the cell membranes of microbes or the viral envelopes of viruses these are trapped and then perforated by the hydrocarbon chains present on the quaternary ammonium which results in their deactivation 7 what iso 217020 iso 22196 certification says a disinfectant product is approved by the european regulation if its microbial elimination rate reaches 99 in 24 hours e coli s aureus 60 60 reference uncoated 0 0 agox 100 100 a 100 100 b 100 100 c 100 100 reference uncoated 0 0 coated glass 100 100 bacterial analysis tcid50 log10 106 stainlees steel glass the lithocide eliminate more than 99 of microbial in less tanh 30 minutes our results following iso 22196 e coli s aureus 60 60 reference uncoated 0 0 agox 100 100 a 100 100 b 100 100 c 100 100 reference uncoated 0 0 coated glass 100 100 bacterial analysis tcid50 log10 106 stainlees steel glass bromothymol blue coloring tests confirmed by xps -
