datum event revolutionizing industrial inspection with digitalization and ai today s industrial inspection options haven t arrived in the 21st century yet they are complex to use and error-prone need trained and experienced personnel require time- consuming analysis and manual data transfer limited solutions on the market that build on today s digital possibilities 3-5 days of training operator 1-2 days for data transfer and analysis average operators only found 60-70 of defects in studies the problem accurate detection of 90 of defects simple - no knowledge or training required fast - 2 minutes per inspection the first digital inspection solution to reduce costs and emissions in plants valves steam traps pumps bearings use cases based on 4000 ground truth measurements conducted
