hybrid composite material assuring durability and sustainability outperforming traditional carbon fibre composites without compromising stiffness and weight 4 traditional carbon fibre composites hybrid composite material durable carbon fibre steel fibre high stiffness high strength low density brittle fracture no warning high stiffness ductile fracture conservation structural integrity low yield point high density feathertm high stiffness high strength low density ductile fracture conservation of integrity carbon fibre in the bicycle industry dramatic fracture behaviour leading to disadvantages poor impact resistance while focusing on durability feathertm is appreciated and noticed by bicycle magazines bicycle reviewers and end consumers o higher impact resistance up to 4x higher o higher tolerance to damages higher threshold for cracks and delamination in the material and o visibility of impact upon impact the steel deforms plastically leading to an indentation and visible damage premium product lightweight high- performance based on standard thermoset systems and manual manufacturing hybrid composite material sustainable o high-lev el of recyclability given remelting and consolidation possibilities of the materials o materials have no limited shelf life and allow for end-of-life recycling next generation of composites is set to redefine the standards of sustainability aiming to become the most environmental- friendly carbon fibre frame set-up of internal reduce reuse recycle program reduce the amount of base materials reuse waste material in the
