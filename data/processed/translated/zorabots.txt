would conceive together tommy partnered with fabrice and so zorabots was born after graduating from antwerp university and an initial experience in an administrative company fabrice became despite his young age 27 director of the world trade center in antwerp belgium he occupied this post until the 11th of september 2001 with him the slightest opportunity can become a business then he turned his attention to the art world and art galleries he ended up by managing 5 of them in all one of which was in dubai being a huge fan of star wars and robotics he met up with tommy and created advanced hospitality systems in bucharest romania they designed a revolutionary handheld touch device with smart home and hotel solutions this was the first technology base for the creation of the zorabots dna tommy deblieck fabrice goffin organizational chart if it is easy everyone will do it right so lets make it easy fabrice tommy with its headquarters in europe belgium zorabots is specialized in software solutions and has created the first windows -like independent robotic software platform called zbos zorabots operating system thanks to its open api zbos opens up to other developers and external integrators thanks to the platform s use of mqtt the iot industry standard communication protocol we assure a frictionless integration with 3rd party devices and services mission statement around 1980 microsoft advanced a clear mission a computer on every desk and in every home today not only everyone has a computer at home but the world has become smart iot devices robots and smart devices have conquered the world did you know that today there are over 3 million robots and 10 billion active iot devices with a growing market like this the need for technical knowledge is key servicing installation and maintaining these devices needs strong technical knowledge with todays war on talent and the future prediction of more shortage on these technical talents we have to solve this problem in a different way zorabots mission has always been to make technical challenges solvable by non technical people if it is easy everyone will do it right so lets make it easy road so far table of contents 01 from robot app to paas zbos for integrators 02 integrators will push zbos as a multi iot platform zbos as oem 03 convincing robotics manufacturors to preinstall zbos zbos

storage business development zorabots zbos is now mature we must look for a partner who can help us with knowledge network and investment 1 500 robots with zorabots software sold worldwide 02 zbos for integrators the internet of things iot and the need of a no-code development ecosystem iot is much more than just intelligent devices we re talking about an ecosystem or web of connected applications and systems including sensors devices data analytics enterprise-user apps and a platform to streamline operations to work effectively these components need to communicate with one another seamlessly without compromising quality or performance zbos allows integrators to unlock what was once impossible and that s just scratching the surface the inter net of things brings unlimited possibilities creating opportunities for businesses to amalgamate disparate devices protocols and enterprise systems for seamless operations managed and controlled by zbos it makes a system integrator and

selling the outcome zbos oem will benefit maximum uptime on demand acces products are maintained proactively etc marketsize growth by 2025 29 25 startups vs established european service robot manufacturers play an important role in the global market about 290 out of the 700 registered companies supplying service robots come from europe north america ranks second with about 240 manufacturers and asia third with about 130 further progress will rely on entrepreneurs taking up disruptive technologies and deploying them for new applications and markets in the us about 200 start-up companies are working on new service robots the european union plus switzerland count 170 companies that are creating a new entrepreneurial culture for the service robotics industry - followed by asia with 135 start-ups virtually all economies are attempting to foster a vibrant entrepreneurial environment and the service robotics industry has become one of the focus areas of their
