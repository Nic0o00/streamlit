stand out nnovation 1 ur photobioreactor inspired by solar towers ur patent-pending photobioreactor solves the problem of delivering massive amounts of sunlight to the cyanobacteria while keeping an optimal temperature range at lowest operational costs he costs for building the is 5 of the costs of existing s he is based on established designs which concentrate sunlight on dark buildings in deserts using a large array of mirrors so called heliostats n our case the sunlight is transported into the culture medium using fiber optics nnovation 2 ur genetically engineered cyanobacteria 001 is our wild-type cyanobacteria strain selected from many after an extensive series of in-house test culture runs mbedded in our process this strain achieves one of the highest absolute sugar contents of all wild-type strains and thus one of the highest yields of bioethanol per invest 001 is our genetically engineered strain based on 001 which accumulates even more sugar up to 80 of the dry mass of the final biomass is glycogen 001 up to 65 his improvement allows for using up to 28 less process inputs reducing cost massively ur ndustrial rocess ---slide--- 11 tep 3 ioethanol ermentation and estillation he harvested cyanobacterial biomass is dewatered yielding a product with comparable key metrics total solids sugar content to that of sugar cane or corn n cyanobacterial biomass sugar is stored as glycogen e enzymatically convert this glycogen into glucose similar to how sucrose in sugar cane and corn is converted into glucose before fermentation fter this the ethanol distillation process remains identical to that used with sugar cane or corn odern ethanol distilleries optimize profitability by monetizing byproducts such as 2 and biomethane through the anaerobic digestion of fermented biomass tep 3 is a fully established process without further innovation an also be outsourced oing this third step in-house however will allow to sell ethanol an already fully tradable product with a great future as biofuel instead of a product - cyanobacterial biomass - which others have no experience with otentially if the chain of production is controlled a surplus on the market ethanol price may be achieved due to the more environmental friendly approach no use of agricultural land even higher emission reduction uture business option ocket fuel ur actual innovation is the production of cheap sugar-rich biomass ur communication however concentrations on bioethanol due to the pursuasive topic of decarbonization of the transport industry owever we can use the sugars to produce biomethane instead of bioethanol just as well by directly anaerboic digestion of the biomass right away ith this we have the cheapest option to produce biomethane which is the rocket fuel of the future used in pace s tarship n fact producing cyanobacterial biomass in closed vessels like we do is much easier to implement on other planets than producing sugar cane or corn ur ndustrial

instead of expensive minerals here is no demand for these recycled nutrients so we erase significant costs from our equation ustom cheap both in construction and operation allows for perfect thermal control and light harvesting at the same time he light heats up the culture medium and sea water is used to cool the culture medium down ith this approach we can keep the optimal temperature range at

sugarcane and corn- based are already reporting losses at the lower end of the price spectrum rices are expected to stabilize as these traditional plants exit the market actors which may limit scaling utrients he process relies on agricultural slurry manure or anaerobic digestate as nutrient sources hese resources are abundant and should not become limiting factors until a significant number of large plants are operational o get around this limitation on the long term we will research on how to improve our process to fully recover all liquid fertilizer nutrients none of these flow into the final product bioethanol including phosphate and ammonia ocations for plants yanobacteria require significantly less space for growth compared to sugar cane tudies indicate that the ustralian desert
