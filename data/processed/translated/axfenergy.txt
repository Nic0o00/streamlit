can be easily repurposed for e100 2013 94 market share of flexible fuel vehicles which run on e100 in brazil since 2008 more bioethanol is sold in brazil than gasoline 7 climate change the production of bioethanol competes with agricultural land most developed countries only mix in small amounts of bioethanol in their gasoline e5 e10 e20 this is enough to make over half of all crops in us and europe flow into the production of bioethanol bioethanol a potential solution with proof-of-concept in brazil we solved the problem of competing with agricultural land by cultivating cyanobacteria the unicelluar photosynthetic microorganisms which plants evolved from and fermenting their biomass with this only a fraction of the desert space of e g australia is needed to produce enough bioethanol to replace the whole gasoline consumption world-wide others of course have already tried to use microorganisms like cyanobacteria or microalgae to produce bioethanol before however their processes are to costly we spent the last three years to research and develop a potentially cheap enough process our industrial process 8 cyanobacteria thrive in tanks filled water and nutrients instead of soil their growth turns water from transparent to dark green step 1 recycling of nutrients liquid fertilizer agricultural slurry manure and anaerobic digestate from biogas plants are rich in all nutrients needed to grow cyanobacteria due to overfertilization in many regions both are distributed for free or the owners even pay for their disposal we help the farmers and biogas plants by separating their s into solid and liquid fertilizer using our trucks they keep the solid fertilizer which they can sell more easily we keep the liquid fertilizer our lab tests established that we can produce clear liquid fertilizer for perfect photosynthesis and that our cyanobacteria grow on these recycled nutrients flocculation of anaerboic digestate in axf energy lab and resulting liquid fertilizer 9 co2 biogas plants and cement producers among others produce co2 as side product this gas is not pure thus cannot be sold at a profit it is blown into the air instead here we pick up co2 at zero cost our industrial process tank flocculation floatation slurry tank reverse osmosis concentration grit collection solid fertilizer 10 step 2 su gar-rich biomass production we grow the cyanobacteria in closed vessels with controlled parameters such as temperature range and co2 concentration a so called photobioreactor or pbr the liquid fertilizer contains all the nutrients required by cyanobacteria to grow except for carbohydrates cyanobacteria can utilize co2 as a source of carbon through photosynthesis large amount of sugar-rich cyanobacterial biomass sea water liquid fertilizer co2 sunlight initial cyanobacteria culture two innovations stand out innovation 1 our photobioreactor inspired by solar towers our patent-pending photobioreactor pbr solves the problem of delivering massive amounts of sunlight to the cyanobacteria while keeping an optimal temperature range at lowest operational costs the costs for building the pbr is 5 of the costs of existing pbrs the pbr is based on established designs which concentrate sunlight on dark buildings in deserts using a large array of mirrors so called heliostats in our case the sunlight is transported into the culture medium using fiber optics innovation 2 our genetically engineered cyanobacteria axf001wt is our wild-type cyanobacteria strain selected from many after an extensive series of in-house test culture runs embedded in our process this strain achieves one of the highest absolute sugar contents of all wild-type strains and thus one of the highest yields of bioethanol per invest axf001opt is our genetically engineered strain based on axf001wt which accumulates even more sugar up to 80 of the dry mass of the final biomass is glycogen axf001wt up to 65 this improvement allows for using up to 28 less process inputs reducing cost massively our industrial process 11 step 3 bioethanol fermentation and destillation the harvested cyanobacterial biomass is dewatered yielding a product with comparable key metrics total solids sugar content to that of sugar cane or corn in cyanobacterial biomass sugar is stored as glycogen we enzymatically convert this glycogen into glucose similar to how sucrose in sugar cane and corn is converted into glucose before fermentation after this the ethanol distillation process remains identical to that used with sugar cane or corn modern ethanol distilleries optimize profitability by monetizing byproducts such as co2 and biomethane through the anaerobic digestion of fermented biomass step 3 is a fully established process without further innovation can also be outsourced doing this third step in-house however will allow to sell ethanol an already fully tradable product with a great future as biofuel instead of a product - cyanobacterial biomass - which others have no experience with potentially if the chain of production is controlled a surplus on the market ethanol price may be achieved due to the more environmental friendly approach no use of agricultural land even higher ghg emission reduction future business option rocket fuel our actual innovation is the production of cheap sugar-rich biomass our communication however concentrations on bioethanol due to the pursuasive topic of decarbonization of the transport industry however we can use the sugars to produce biomethane instead of bioethanol just as well by directly anaerboic digestion of the biomass right away with this we have the cheapest option to produce biomethane which is the rocket fuel of the future used in spacex s starship in fact producing cyanobacterial biomass in closed vessels like we do is much easier to implement on other planets than producing sugar cane or corn our industrial process 12 we convert abundant resources without value to owners nutrient recycling culture medium co2 sugar-rich biomass production sugar-rich biomass bioethanol fermentation and destillation bioethanol a tradable product with large market into axf energy is the first to join all of these usps together in total resulting into a likely competitive process to produce bioethanol use of recycled nutrients instead of expensive minerals there is no demand for these recycled nutrients so we erase significant costs from our equation custom cheap pbr both in construction and operation allows for perfect thermal control and light harvesting at the same time the light heats up the culture medium and sea water is used to cool the culture medium down with this approach we can keep the optimal temperature range at low cost efficiency of an entrepreneur-run startup instead of researcher spin-off or large group management has 18 years of experience of running sta rt-ups not a 4th generation ethanol production process direct ethanol production using genetically engineered cyanobacteria this is the path that the research community has been following for the last 15 years however our r d shows this is a dead end storing the glycogen in bacteria s walls and fermenting later is the key to keep contamination in check all optimization possibilities were exhausted to obtain the most sugar-containing biomass including the task of genetically engineering cyanobacteria we have extensive knowledge in biochemistry automation robotics and computer science supplemented with the knowledge of industrial processes and plant construction vp of engineering we will be able to continue our r d mostly in-house this allows us to continue our operations efficiently and swiftly our industrial process current us market price of ethanol 0 47 liter in the past 20 years the price has been between 0 35 and

future plan 16 the following problems may arise derailing us from our plan too expensive process we have modeled the complete construction and operational costs of the plant based on laboratory tests and existing literature however unforeseen factors or overlooked aspects may result in the process not being as cost-effective as anticipated possibile mitigation additional research and development funded through an extra investment round explore the possibility of higher pricing for green bioethanol through strategic lobbying regulatory risks the large-scale use of genetically engineered cyanobacteria despite their environmental safety along with the disposal of decontaminated material into the sea may require extensive discussions to secure necessary permits this could potentially delay the construction of our first plant possible mitigation early collaboration with the local government the permit situation is taken into account when selecting the site to build the plant market price of bioethanol while unlikely there is a risk that the market price of bioethanol could drop below the usual range however this is improbable since many traditional ethanol plants sugarcane and corn- based are already reporting losses at the lower end of the price spectrum prices are expected to stabilize as these traditional plants exit the market factors which may limit scaling nutrients the process relies on agricultural slurry manure or anaerobic digestate as nutrient sources these resources are abundant and should not become limiting factors until a significant number of large plants are operational to get around this limitation on the long term we will research on how to improve our process to fully recover all liquid fertilizer nutrients none of these flow into the final product bioethanol including phosphate and ammonia locations for plants cyanobacteria require significantly less space for growth compared to sugar cane studies indicate that the australian desert alone is sufficient to produce enough bioethanol to replace global gasoline usage however other aspects also have to fit industry to gather nutrients reachable via trucks connection to sea or lake even if established via longer pipes investor value proposition 17 first revenue in 2027 break-even right after full expansion planned for end of 2028 5 of construction cost expected as ebitda 4 mio
