linkedin com in alexandre-ortigier-600b74a8 hélène vermont sustainable purchasing manager michelin linkedin com in helene-vermont-50b20a6 implementing the slim strategic project was a huge challenge we had to get a clear picture of the maintenance parts in order to identify duplicates we did the maths this task would last for 20 years with 2 collaborators at full time there were no automatic existing solution neither among our cmms suppliers nor among the most advanced innovative brokers we tried to do something with one of them but it failed we met kheoos and within 2 weeks a successful poc was realised not only could we get a clear and unprecedent enriched ref catalogue but we could also send them through their market place in addition to this the easy and smooth relationships with kheoos team definitely turns the poc into a full purchase order we are also very excited by hearing about the kheoos pool sustainable project to fulfil broader sustainable corporate objectives as the person in charge of purchasing and sustainable development projects at the group level we are constantly seeking to help cross-functional and regional teams find the right solutions to achieve our 4rs objectives reduce reuse recycle renew at michelin - like our peers in the industry- the question of sustainable development is no longer an issue on the other hand implementation is sometimes difficult because it is not only a matter of changing mindsets but also of operating on a large scale while meeting the group s financial objectives the stakes are high because either the levers of sustainable development are not all identified or the solutions to operate the transformation do not exist or the costs are too high kheoos takes up these three challenges which is unique we will soon
