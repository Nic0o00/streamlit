climate change and the corona outbreak are important wake up calls for our society with ever improving robotics artificial intelligence and legislative frameworks for unmanned aerial vehicles uav s in europe we have no choice but to implement simpler faster more reliable and more cost-efficient automated security safety and inspection checks the tolerance for human error is at an all-time low physical human proximity is extremely expensive remote proximity is cheaper faster and often better identified findings problems intelligent drones manufactured locally the highly price competitive market of security and service companies overall is looking for solutions there is a need for automatization robotization with same or higher output as human personnel helicopter deployment for inspections crowd control overall emergency support is very expensive police emergency services need more frequent situational overview not constrained by budget sea ports are in need of general overviews and inspection of infrastructure and docks the security aspect is also very important for sea ports today it requires an immense deployment of personnel and it s quite impossible to have a complete overview human oversights and errors are common renewable energy plants wind turbines solar panel plants etc are in need of affordable and precise inspections and maintenance solutions having maintenance teams onsite is expensive but repairing and cleaning on time is very important for optimal energy supply so a balance must be found between cheaper and more frequent inspections and the actual human maintenance interventions confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix the solution aerial robots confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix aerial robots are the solution they are

firms the market drones are an eyecatcher for the industry confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix the boston consulting group estimates the industrial drone turnover in europe and the us to be over 30 billion by 2030 the european commission estimates the global number of mass-market drones at 35 million units by 2022 of which some 25 will be in europe to tap into this market the most profitable and efficient solution for drone technology applications on an industrial scale is a shared services model where a single drone installation will deliver multiple services to multiple end-users segmentation - positioning specific industries unlimited vertical applications confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix we are aiming at very specific markets that have very specific needs thus enabling us to create niche drone like yacob able to compete with mass production robots with the integration in the 6th network the availablity of almost unlimited vertical applications is key for these targets and the industries they work in we are aiming at smart cities communities government agencies and emergency services police ambulance fire brigade private industry companies with very large sites requiring inspection and security sea ports airports renewable energy sites plants the competition a new concept - a new market confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix the main competitors of yacob are uav builders airobotics israel airscort israel percepto israel skye nightingale newzealand we have a strategic advantage over all these drone builders we are far more cost efficient with more affordable drones with more features we also have a different concept development thus overcoming many problems these companies face in the building deploying and operating of these systems we have almost perfected these steps being able to service any customer very fast worldwide since this is a new market development all the traditional ways of operating security and inspection missions are potential competitors since we are looking to disrupt the market with cost efficient unmanned solutions these should not be problematic to overcome we have conducted a more elaborated competitor analysis which can be consulted here competitive advantage proven technology confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix as mentioned before we have a strategic advantage because we offer a far more cost efficient solution with more affordable drones we also have a different concept development almost perfecting building deploying and operating of our yacob drone and docking station thus able to service any customer very fast worldwide mayor of antwerp bart de wever and his chief of police serge muyters police and bert brugghemans fire brigade are satisfied with an experiment that fit into a larger european droneproject de wever sees many advantages compared to the current police helicopter yacob is cheaper much faster and above all much quieter if the people of

is equiped with all technology that is needed competitive advantage proven technology business incubation center testing center confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix our valuable ecosystem the presence of droneport is crucial for dronematrix to further develop contacts on the drone business we are therefore very involved with all initiatives of droneport for major testing and visits of important partners droneport is ideal for presenting our company competitive advantage proven technology production center our technology is key the concept of the hardware gives us a competitive edge artificial intelligence on board dronematrix inside total cost of ownership is low smart-factory smart-everything can be locally assembled by lowtech personel competitive confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix our valuable ecosystem the economic model platform for drone hardware software the business model of the yacob system and the 6th network is quite straight-forward the sales of the hardware installations to key segments is important along with maintenance and service contracts the continuous development of the operating software platform on the 6th network will be key to drive hardware sales there will be licencing fees for the usage of the operating software platform by end users there will also be a fee to allow the integration of vertical applications by third parties app builders we will not develop our own apps but are driving partnerships to have large it-integrators develop their own next to this we will also be supporting the integration of third party hardware into the network up to par with 6th network standards by the same operating software licencing fees industrialization a roadmap the yacob can be described as mvp where the technology nor the production is a challenge today delivery times are maximum 4 weeks and the cost price clearly lower than competitors due to smart manufacturing and conceptual differences our network of partners goes beyond national and european borders as we know the important players and experts in their field confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix marketing sales - communication a niche approach confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix since we are aiming for a very specific target market the sales of hardware solutions and the network that supports this should not be marketed by general means we should therefor aim to - send out targeted e-mailings - use the personal networks to get in touch with key decision makers - conduct and organize demo events and opportunities - highlight success stories via social media preferably linkedin of which we already have multiple internationally - seek out the key players in every targeted segment sea ports airports captains of industry - seek out and grow a network within emergency services and government agencies we have currently one of the best networks of belgium in this segment so we could build on this internationally - have web

production services confidential 09 2020 copyright dronematrix dronematrix wants to grow internationally with the manufacturing and sales of the yacob drone and docking station system we are targeting a market share of 50 to achieve this in a sustainable manner we want to keep evolving our 6th network and become the reference platform for the integration of drone hardware and services in many industries and ultimately in everyday life a drone at everyone s fingertips we want to join industrya to find the necessary means to grow and grow fast to keep an edge over the us and china based initiatives that might emerge we need to be able to gain a head start and develop our technology making it harder for them to catch up which they could potentially do given enough capital rather than allowing this to ha ppen we want to grow to discourage them to be a competitor and encourage them to join the 6th network
