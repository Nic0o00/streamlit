over the mid-infrared laser market confidential 4 quantum-cascade lasers qcl are semiconductor laser diodes that have unique mid-ir detection properties dircm directional ir countermeasures qcl have replaced other mid-ir laser solutions leas-salt lasers fiber lasers gas lasers opo thanks to a much better combination of compactness affordability as well as wavelength availability purity the new frontier for qcls is to achieve integration into embedded solutions through miniaturization and cost-reduction spectroscopy gas detection molecular spectroscopy qcl have won out over other technologies such as opo thanks to their compactness affordability and power efficiency 10x the new frontier for qcls is to increase emission power to expand its application to any airborne and ground platform optical parametric oscillators ---slide--- mirsense is in pole position for qcl-based embedded solutions confidential 5 first mid-ir laser integrated sensors we drastically reduce qcl cost 10-fold reduction of chip cost ability to integrate non- packaged lasers only player to cover the full mid-ir spectral range the first smart qcl asic unique asic design for all qcl applications 100-fold cost reduction vs complex electronic boards compactness x100 unit price 100 mems microphones as a mid-ir detector unique integration skills of photo-acoustics with qcl 1000-fold cost
