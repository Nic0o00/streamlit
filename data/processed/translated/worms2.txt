universal physical phenomenon just like temperature or pressure it is interesting to measure it pretty much everywhere vibration enable access in a nondestructive way to a wealth of information of the inner state of a system from far away the best value for the quality of information obtained today vibration data quality is long acknowledged but access to the data stays difficult sensor data
