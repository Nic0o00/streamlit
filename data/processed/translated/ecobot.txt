improve productivity with on-site logistic flow software solutions and cooperative robots helping humans project centaur - pitch deck introduction why e-cobot when i was 10 years old i was working with my grandfathers one a garage owner and the other a carpenter as they grew older their strength and agility diminished despite their persistent desire to put on their overalls what if it was possible to design solutions that would help people in their daily lives by improving their performance this idea supported by my passions - industry robotics artificial intelligence biomechanics - allowed me to create in 2016 e-cobot e-cobot aims to design cobotized solutions improving human performance with cobots collaborative robots sébastien ecault president e-cobot 2 confidential industrya 3 cobotics what is it the cobot a machine designed not to replace a worker and take his job but to help him do the job more efficiently and with reduced risk of injury jon van 11 décembre 1996 mechanical advantage chicago tribune the basis of cobotics is the cooperation of a robot with a human not its replacement confidential industrya rising labor costs increasing labor turnover and shortages need to optimize on-site operational flow with easily implementable and user-friendly robotic solutions number of sectors have to modernize operations to remain competitive by increasing the level of automation and implementing cooperative robot technology addressing major productivity issues with cooperative robotics technologies global megatrends 4 confidential industrya various solutions exist with apparent very close performance levels but significant differences in complexity of installation efficiency reliability flexibility consideration for safety of goods and cost beyond robot technology added value for end users can only be guaranteed if they have access to a global sw hw services solution to optimize their operational flow simplified project assessment smooth implementation optimized operations e-cobot simplifying access to cobotics while addressing complex supply chain situations cooperative automation it s more than just a robot 5 unlocking access to on-site operational flow management solutions confidential industrya 1101 111 1000 10011 0101 111 1000 10011 on site material flow facilitating on-site logistics flow management supply of raw materials products etc shipment of goods waste removal etc supply chain cobots data flow inflow outflow operational flow warehouse factory stores operation flow optimization solutions to improve efficiency safety profitability 6 confidential industrya 15 000 in 2019 50 growth forecast every years up to 170 000 units in 2025 sources statista venturebeat menafn 4 300 cobots sold in the world in 2015 4 8 of the total industrial robots installed globally were cobots in 2019 670 m market size in 2015 9 300 m market size by 2027 only cobotics potential global market sizing 7 confidential industrya i received a new order i need to send a kit to the production i have asked new parts and i know i will receive them in x minutes agv amr forklift always the same way and at the same schedule can change its route and schedule a delivery when it s necessary physical flow information flow end-to end software cobot 1 2 our solution production line operator order picker organize the delivery traffic management software to manage logistics flows digitalize supply and intelligent scheduling of requests make the delivry fleets of mobile robots to manage multi-brand and multi-model physical flows depending on the logistics units to be transported 8 confidential industrya mycobot manager configuration supervision management software create maps i create assignments i mission management i supervision i dashboard i product and user configuration guarantee delivery in x minutes intelligent mobile robot embbeding mobile cobot operating system localization i physical cyber security i navigation i communication i pack synchronization mycobot user flexible user interface control i mission launch i cycling mission i simplified configurable interface a catalog of products a catalog of extension modules for specific business needs mycobot iot range of intelligent control equipment sensor controller actuator etc end-to end software cobot 2 2 proprietary technologies 9 confidential industrya a smart mobile cobot 3 operating modes follower autonomous remote controled carries up to 250 kg tows up to 1 ton battery life 16 hr safety vision 360 mycobot a wide range of accessories husky 1 3 main features 10 confidential industrya 2 innovation programs 1 5m over 3 years 50 financed by the bpi and ademe 2 cifres theses husky 2 3 a large product range addressing various use cases 150 000 68 husky produced 15 000 km travelled 25 customer sites with husky installations 12 different use cases of husky 400 accessories devices in the catalog hours of development in development validation poc and integration 11 confidential industrya q1 2020 q2 2020 q3 2020 q4 2020 q1 2021 q2 2021 q3 2021 q4 2021 q1 2022 time number of km realised on customer plant 2 000 4 000 6 000 8 000 10 000 12 000 14 000 hsk 11 -
