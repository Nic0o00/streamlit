exactly work slow down of ventilation when going below the threshold over-consumption of energy with ai indoor air quality without ai activation of ventilation by anticipation slowing down of ventilation by anticipation of thresholds activation of ventilation when the threshold is exceeded over-consumption period of energy without ai 35 min 1h30 istya alert threshold security threshold measure time indoor air quality with ai ai anticipates exceeding the indoor air quality safety threshold it triggers the ventilation upstream to ventilate the space the pollution peak lasts less and the ventilation is less operational less powerful over a shorter period of time the company saves energy and money 07 ---slide--- 08 business model and distribution channels direct sales b2b
