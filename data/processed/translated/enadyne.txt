he solution 2 ource oth green hydrogen and green methane are suitable hydrogen sources ossil hydrogen sources are possible but yield no decarbonizing effect he focus is therefore on 2 produced via electrolysis 4 produced in biogas plants n the long term also 2 is possible s primary product the reactor selectively produces one out of a variety of hydrocarbons in a single-staged highly selective process - uels and - uel pre-products eedstock for the chemical industry thylene alcohols aldehydes etc s byproducts most synthesis processes create xygen ure solid carbon he solid carbon allows permanent carbon sequestration nergy -
