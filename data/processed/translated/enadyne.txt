con dential 20201023 v27 2 executive summary enadyne stands for advanced and sustainable plasma-based solutions enadyne stands for plasma reactors that selectively convert co2 and a hydrogen source into synthetic base chemicals and e-fuels in a single process step the core process has an unprecedented energy efficiency allows complete carbon neutrality and is highly scalable the technology solves several critical challenges at the same time the profitable reduction of industrial co2 emissions the scalable production of synthetic fuels the sustainable replacement of fossil feedstock with the flexible production of synthetic hydrocarbons the electrode material that is key to the technology has been patented several times and the project is supported by a network of renowned r d partners beyond that enadyne was awarded as one of the most promising projects for the sustainable reduction of co2 emissions by the german federal agency for disruptive innovation sprin-d in its recent carbon-to-value challenge enadyne reactor prototype click here for a brief video overview ---slide--- 2022 enadyne - con dential 20201023 v27 3 to overcome the climate crisis at speed and scale technology must meet three criteria active reduction of co2 emissions just reducing co2 emissions will not allow us to reach net-zero as certain emissions are not avoidable there is an urgent need for active carbon dioxide reduction technologies profitable application relying on subsidies will not solve the problem to achieve a widespread application of the technology and its products it must achieve a profit for its users production of sustainable resources a sufficient supply of sustainably produced chemicals and fuels is the only way to achieve a lasting independence of fossil oil and gas without hurting existing value chains the challenge ---slide--- 2022 enadyne - con dential 20201023 v27 4 any process that produces relevant co2 emissions is suitable as co2 source possible sources are for example biogas plants cement steel- and aluminum production in the long run direct air capture might be a valid alternative the enadyne technology profitably converts co2 into green chemical feedstock and e-fuels the solution co2 source both green hydrogen and green methane are suitable hydrogen sources fossil hydrogen sources are possible but yield no decarbonizing effect the focus is therefore on h2 produced via electrolysis ch4 produced in biogas plants in the long term also h2o is possible as primary product the reactor selectively produces one out of a variety of hydrocarbons in a single-staged highly selective process e-fuels and e-fuel pre-products feedstock for the chemical industry ethylene alcohols aldehydes etc as byproducts most synthesis processes create oxygen pure solid carbon the solid carbon allows permanent carbon sequestration energy - technology is carbon neutral from 80 re-share secondary products primary product harmful emissions become valuable resources h source plasma catalysis beyond this several other use cases like the production of ammonia from nitrogen and h2 are possible ---slide--- 2022 enadyne - con dential 20201023 v27 5 enadyne technology establishes a carbon negative resource cycle added value in the context of the energy transition a large part of the global co2 load comes from processes in industry and transport and energy generation the co2 produced in this way is essentially still emitted as waste gas industry transportation co2 negative resource cycle co2- capturing co2 storage c several technologies already deal with the capture of co2 from exhaust gases and the atmosphere in principle these technologies help to reduce co2 emissions however the question of what happens to the co2 after being captured remains unanswered enadyne s technology allows the direct conversion of co2 into chemicals that can be returned to the system thus for the first time a closed co2 cycle can be established fed by renewable green energy or if the products are used in activities with high storage potential like plastics production the cycle can even be made co2 negative technology ---slide--- 2022 enadyne - con dential 20201023 v27 6 enadyne is the only technology that combines four vital technology advantages technology advantages 20210723-1 more efficient plasma catalysis technology works just above room temperature and around ambient pressure this allows the selective conversion of co2 to green resources in a single process step with an energy efficiency far above that of common technologies more flexible the technology can selectively and flexibly produce diverse chemical feedstocks and e-fuels it is also independent of green hydrogen as it can also use biomethane as a hydrogen source moreover its ramp-up time is only a few minutes more scalable enadyne pursues a modular approach in which cost-effective reactors are connected in parallel this enables efficient series production and qualifies the technology for both scaled industrial as well as decentralized applications more sustainable the enadyne technology can be operated co2 neutrally with as little as 80 re share since small portions of processed carbon are captured in solid form furthermore no rare earths are required for production and operation of the reactors ---slide--- 2022 enadyne - con dential 20201023 v27 7 the technology is developed as a modularly scalable container solution modular scaling approach 20210723-1 enadyne reactor modular scaling approach the enadyne reactor is based on our functionalized ceramics material that is patented several times the plasma-active properties of the material allow us to build up a highly selective nonthermal plasma only slightly above room temperature depending on how the material is adjusted the process can be used to yield a variety of different products instead of further scaling the reactor we pursue a modular approach in which we cluster up to 250 reactors the chosen approach allows a centralized and more scalable production and more flexibility for our customers most of the peripheral technology1 is standard technology that is enabled by our core material this way significant parts of the production can be performed by external partners enadyne reactor design 1 for example gas separation gas management and power supply ---slide--- 2022 enadyne -
