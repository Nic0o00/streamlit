holy synergy the future of integrated manufacturing for composites our system solution a next-generation manufacturing system designed to maximize efficiency by delivering performance that exceeds the sum of its individual elements what is it holy synergy development core activity serial production core activity recycling enabling activity holy os software backbone the software-centric nature of our system enables continuous improvement with every component produced driving a compounding competitive advantage over time ---slide--- the solution creates disruptive possibilities for the products of our customers unique value proposition up to 50 cost savings up to 70 lighter stiffer new geometries unlocked 100 recyclable our technology enables components that are designed for recycling achieving full circularity ---slide--- we deliver pre-serial prototypes at lightspeed product 1 development reduce the time to pre-serial prototype from 12 months to 10 working days our objective customer journey starts with interest to build a component through us they are looking to receive a prototype before transitioning to serial production from cad to prototype ---slide--- our software-centric system helps customers unlock the full potential of their components customer sends us a cad-file plus specifications of their component we compute the ideal fiber path with hyper- local reinforcement we place the fibers with a highly-efficient fully automated robotic process our finished components do not require any post- processing 1 2 3 4 product 1 development ---slide--- we produce composite components at scale product 2 serial production run a robotic production line with capacity of 500 units week at 99 production yield customers make purchase orders for 10 to 1000s of

intent to lead vision how we see composite manufacturing 5 years from now we will have transitioned from manual production to a fully autonomous system - where robots run the entire process continuously learning and improving faster than any human-led operation ever could the future of production our unfair advantage means we can serve customers better than anyone else we can provide
