3 investment opportunity torwash developed a unique proprietary technology to covert sludge into fully circular resources for bio chemicals and fuels the modular torwash system combines the torwash reactor including the unique torwash technology with existing components enabling decentralised sludge processing and fit for copy past expansion to plants globally the asset-light business model combines a boo build-own-operate and technology licensing model including the sale of the torwash reactor where torwash maintains control over the essential hardware the reactor in 2019 the 1st pilot installation was built municipal capacity 25kg hr trl6 followed by a demo installation municipal capacity 500kg hr trl7 in 2023 which has been operating successfully design of the first full-scale commercial torwash installation industrial capacity 5000kg hr trl 8 is scheduled for q3 2025 followed by its construction commissioning in 2026 first revenues expected in 2027 large addressable markets including industrial municipal wwtp s and system integrators ---slide--- 4 we are torwash general manager business developer raised 3 6m levien de lege ceo co-founder project manager torwash

typically three channels of disposal 1 incineration ii landfill or iii used as fertilizers in agriculture in europe landfill and sludge as fertilizers is becoming restricted due to legislation on environmental contamination incineration is the only option left but insufficient capacity high prices and rising no circular products no water recycling co2 intensive use of fossil chemicals and extensive road transport sludge incineration sludge is waste not a resource centralised treatment capital intensive high opex fossil chemicals pe used not circular sewage sludge a global challenge
