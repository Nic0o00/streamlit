The Starklab CO2 capture solution on 4 01 2023 --- Slide --- Carbodown presents this Pitch Book in the context of awareness of CO2 capture process as well as its Carbodown commercial potential aims to raise 27 million D to finance its first 3 years of activity as well as different demonstrators on target geographic areas and in future E-SAF --- SLIDE-The International Energy Agency considers in the Net Zero scenario by 2050 NZE made public in 2021 that to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 7 6 GT of CO2 will have to be captured per year from 2050, ie 20 of current emissions. GT of CO2 in 2035, a 100 factor to reach in less than 15 years the IPCC announced that all the models highlight that the CO2 capture will be necessary to hold the objective of decarbonation by 2050 President Macron indicated during his speech on November 08, 2022 that CO2 capture is a strategic axis of the fight against climate change Carbodown responds to this major issue The first step in the abolition of 90 of the emissions from the heavy industry which represent 25 of the total emissions and then in a second step by participating in the production of fuel and synthetic plastics within the framework of a circular economy of the C02 Context and challenges --- Slide --- Carbodown is a reversible process designed by Staklab of all types of oxycombustion boilers Carbodown S embodies in a demonstrator co -financed by EDF and Dalkia designed on the basis of a commercial boiler with a standard burner No replacement of industrial equipment operates indifferently in ambient air and in oxycombustion The passage from one mode to the other being automatic process constantly a process of concentration of CO2 of 90 has been reached in smoke a classic CO2 combustion. Starklab fumes created the company Carbodown to carry the commercial development of its latest innovation Carbodown An innovation of rupture on the CCUS market --- Slide --- Carbodown A global CCUS market in strong growth according to the 2022 report of the Global CCS Institute The CO2 capture market increases from 44 in a year https status22 Projects in progress worldwide 61 started in the year 2022 the Norwegian Energy Energy Research Cabinet which estimates that the CO2 capture and storage equipment market should quadruple between 2022 and 2025 to cumulate more than 50 billion dollars in 2025 --- Slide --- Carbodown a world market According to the special report on capturing the use and storage of CO2 published by the IEA in 2020, the global CO2 storage capacity would be between 8,000 and 55,000 gigatons, so even the lowest 8,000 GT figure exceeds very far the 100 GT of CO2 which should be stored by 2055 in the sustainable development scenario always according to the AIE. Land storage is estimated between 6,000 GT and 42,000 GT while offshore capacity would be between 2,000 GT and 13,000 GT by considering only the sites located less than 300 kilometers from the coast at water depths below 300 meters and outside the Arctic and the Antarctic --- Slide --- In 2028 Carbodown has the ambition of of CO2 released in France by industrial processes or 22 Mt of CO2 The

company Research is development created in 2011 by Audrey Keunebrock Engineer and Jaouad Zemmouri Professor of universities specializing in fundamental physics and member of the Phillame Lasers Lasers of Lasers atoms and Molecules UMR 8523 which is classified at a level of leading excellence at the global level and laureate of several projects labeled as part of the Investments of Future Pia Starklab is specialized in Solutions to process gas and energy performance It has developed several R D 1 R -1 programs a first program of a budget of 100,000 euros funded by Bpifrance to design the first bases of a high performance heat exchanger Terrao The valuation of Terrao technology on the thermal engineering market then gave rise to the creation in 2013 of the Terraotherm subsidiary in 2015 Dalkia acquires an operating license to install Terrao in municipal aquatic centers in March 2014 Starklab created the company Terraotherm which carries out the air and smoke depollution activities by means of its 3 Terraotherm Terraosave and Terraopure 2 processes in 2016 Starklab launches a second program of heat recovery and smoke depollution as part of the recycling of the energy of high temperatures with high temperatures with high temperatures with high temperatures with high temperatures Launched by the RATP SNCF Airparif and Ile-de-France Mobilités to experiment with the capture of fine particles and other pollutants present in the Paris metro which benefits from a subsidy of 200,000 euros The Terraosave technology which comes from this project receives the label of the Solar Foundation Impulse in July 2017 on May 27, 2020 Starklab is retained by the Innovation Defense agency to adapt its technology As part of the fight against the COVID 19 because Terrao makes it possible to neutralize viral particles without adding chemical elements in the atmosphere on December 8, 2020 L State on the one hand via the investment program for the future and on the other hand the Banque des Territories jointly invest 4 m for 11 each of the capital of Starklab 3 in 2021 Starklab launches its third program of R D and invests with the help of EDF and Dalkia 1 million D euros for the development of carbodown technology This program led in July 2022 to the start of a demonstrator in 2023 StarkLab created the company Carbodown which bears the activity of capturing CO2 The Starklab group displays 70 references in France and in Europe and employs around thirty employees The CA 2021 was 5 m in 2021 it is more than 7m in 2022 --- SLIDE --- The StarkLab group dedicated

that it is possible to equip a conventional gas boiler with a CO2 capture system This system is made up of oxycombustion that consists of concentrating CO2 in fumes before purifying them by condensation of water to thus capture CO2 easily and to lower CO2 concentration rate of more than 90 has been reached in smoke a classic combustion product 8 to 9 of CO2 in smoke --- Slide ---

professions its attractiveness being in particular based on a policy Layout for profit-sharing and generous participation as well as on a Carbodown continuing education policy will favor the development of medium-sized workshops including fifty employees within the framework of a geographical distribution by large French region in order to be the highest loan of the market, it is also quite possible to subcontract a part of production for example that of the sheaths with specialized companies concerning the International Carbodown Development will follow the same logic Workshops in very potential basins --- Slide --- carbodown An industrializable production of a fine knowledge of the park of installed boilers allows Carbodown to indutrimal its production, particularly within the framework of partnerships with boilers producers Boile producers are experiencing a strong evolution of their market whose customers want to reduce their emission of GHG. Uvre consists of changing the boiler, in particular for the benefit of boiler equipped with oxycombusttion burner, this solution implies for the customer an important capex as well as a strong impact on production a partnership with carbodown to equip the existing boilers' park is for boilers a way to mitigate the risk of not being selected for the supply of the new boiler while being an OPPORT Growth of growth within the framework of their maintenance contract A partnership materialized by a Skid command calendar characterized a gradual growth of volumes from carbodown miniseries can then operate a scale-up planning of pre-financed production by the payment of a deposit --- Slide --- The carbodown carbodown offer.
