developing a cost- leading dac technology for mass scale deployment 3 introduction to carbyon about carbyon dutch company founded in 2019 spin-off from the dutch research institute on applied science tno supported by the main dutch machine manufacturers world-leaders in deep-tech machinery targets to become a mass- producer of direct air capture machines unique technology from the semiconductor world to lower the costs of direct air capture to eur 100 tco2 ---slide--- confidential copyright 2023 by carbyon all rights reserved carbyon aims to mitigate climate change by providing a solution that captures carbon dioxide directly out of ambient air 4 1 the capex costs of dac are determined by the reactor density a measure for the amount of co2 that can be produced from air during 1 year with 1 m3 of reactor value proposition unique value proposition challenge i realizing a net- zero world in 2050 challenge ii cost of dac lower than eur 100 tco2 humans emit 40 billion ton of co2 year the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere has risen from 280ppm to approximately 420ppm in 2022 driving climate change global targets have been set to bring the level of global co2 emissions to zero by around 2050 to realize this target the world needs deep emission cuts across industries a portfolio of carbon capture solutions within the portfolio of carbon capture solutions dac is increasingly seen as one of the most promising technologies for large scale future deployment due to its scalability permanence verifiability the main challenge for dac is to further reduce the cost related to capturing co2 from the air a cost of dac below eur 100 tco2 will make it a gigaton-scale solution by 2050 to help tackle climate change carbyon is developing a unique dac technology characterized by a low machine size and low capex carbyon demonstrated a reactor density1 of 140 ton per year per m3 which is around 10 times higher than any other technology so far the next step is to optimize the energy budget and further optimize the dac machine carbyon targets a dac cost well below eur 100 tco2 and is well positioned to become one of the first companies to reach this threshold ---slide---

dac if technology costs come down in line with forecasts dac can increasingly replace other cdr technologies such as beccs carbyon estimate of 2050 dac capacity is 5 000 mtco2 with benchmark estimates ranging from 1 000 to 15 000 mtco2 ---slide--- confidential copyright 2023 by carbyon all rights reserved carbyon has a unique approach to dac it is the only company developing a fast-swing sorbent based on thin film technology 6 source carbyon description of carbyon s technology carbyon s technology is based on a fast-swing thin film technology used in the world of microelectronics this approach is unique carbyon is the only dac company developing a fast-swing sorbent material and has filed a pct patent application a demonstration reactor with capacity of 6t co2 year is in place to further test the sorbent material and the energy budget high absorption surface area 3 000 m2 surface area per gram of sorbent material fast cycles sorbent saturation takes minutes and only seconds to de-gas vs 6-hour cycles of key competitors like climeworks low machine capex carbyon s fast swing sorbent can produce 10 times more co2 per year resulting in smaller machine size and lower capex here is what carbyon does key technology advantages ---slide--- confidential copyright 2023 by carbyon all rights reserved today today carbyon s technology allows for a low capex which provides a strong edge compared to competition 7 source carbyon analysis opex efficiency capex efficiency carbyon technology compared to competition 2030 approach challenge key player dac technology comparison selection liquid state absorption solid state adsorption fast swing solid state adsorption co2 dissolves in a liquid volume only cost effective at large mt scale requires high temperatures to recover co2 adhesion of co2 to a solid surface based on solid state diffusion cycle is lengthy leading to low reactor density and high capex lifetime challenges of sorbent material co2 dissolves to a solid surface based on gas phase diffusion the porous sorbent tends to adsorb a lot of h2o comparison of selected players illustrative carbyon s fast swing sorbent can produce 10 times more co2 per year resulting in smaller machine size and lower capex carbyon is expected to maintain its strong capex edge compared to competition given technological constraints of competitor sorbent material 2030 advantage good air contactor leading to efficient co2 absorption limited water uptake resulting in an efficient energetic process high reactor density resulting in low capex cost effective at small scale and with intermittent energy source ---slide--- confidential copyright 2023 by carbyon all rights reserved planned developments on the sorbent material will bring carbyon s carbon capture costs
