increase demand for green options reen hydrogen 2 plays an important role in this by decarbonizing industry and heavy-duty transportation owever many green hydrogen solutions are still too expensive small or inefficient to meet energy needs of the customers any planned green hydrogen investments lack economic rationale high and thus most final investment decisions have been canceled or significantly delayed n top of electricity cost and utilization the 2 cost is dependent on electrolyser efficiency capital cost and lifetime targate has developed a solution to the problem by
