madame sustainability and preserving natural resources are among the most pressing challenges of this era ambitious climate neutrality goals tightening climate regulations and increasingly important esg in every sector strongly increase demand for green options green hydrogen h2 plays an important role in this by decarbonizing industry and heavy-duty transportation however many green hydrogen solutions are still too expensive small or inefficient to meet energy needs of the customers many planned green hydrogen investments lack economic rationale high capex opex and thus most final investment decisions have been canceled or significantly delayed on top of electricity cost and utilization the h2 cost is dependent on electrolyser efficiency capital cost and lifetime stargate has developed a solution to the problem by developing next-generation alkaline electrolysers for green hydrogen production with increased efficiency and lifetime while reducing capital cost the core ip relies on precious metal-free ceramic material-level innovation and innovative electrolyser stack design stargate is now raising additional equity of eur 10m to further develop its technology to reach target cost-down levels to compete with chinese electrolyser manufactures to build up additional capabilities for commercial operations and to complete the production capacity scale stargate has delivered its already cost-competitive generation 1 products to multiple customers and due to growing sales pipeline stargate is now scaling its current mw -scale production capacity of electrolyser stacks and systems further stargate has received strong support from public funding to escalate the capacity ramp-up incl eur 34m of public grants on the following pages you will find details about

alternative but is more expensive soec technology is presently at a lower trl and not ready for scale if technology developers are successful soec can become a competitive alternative in the future

market overview alkaline pem soec ---slide--- confidential company presentation may 2024 stargate solves the electrolysis issue of relatively low efficiency and high capex alkaline electrolysis is the most robust and proven form of water electrolysis to produce hydrogen reliability lifetime is one of the top advantages of alkaline there are still systems in use from the 1960 s despite the proven technology it faces challenges there are two types of alkaline electrolysers nickel-based and platinum group metals pgm -based nickel-based suffer from low efficiencies and densities pgm-based electrolysers can reach high current densities and high efficiency but their wider adoption is hindered by raw material availability and high capex stargate s core technology builds upon the best aspects of proven alkaline technology which the company complements with breakthrough ceramic materials developed in-house called stardust this leads to a completely new class of alkaline electrolysers ceramics- based that boast high current densities and high efficiencies yet contain no precious metals stargate electrolysers are lower capex and opex enabling green hydrogen to be
