perfect solution to the industry s fundamental challenges solution requirements industry challenges speed and cost traditional express transportation methods are highly susceptible to traffic congestion putting pressure on delivering fast on-time and creating unexpected costs climate impact traditional express transportation methods exert a significant climate impact due to their heavy reliance on fossil fuels contributing to greenhouse gas emissions lack of integration customers miss real-time information and digitized platforms and therefore fail to grab the opportunity to optimize the efficiency of their operations fast and reliable deliveries customers expect express transportation to be fast and predictable sustainable transport express transportation methods are required to shift towards more sustainable alternatives e g battery-driven vehicles to lower the impact on the climate transparent delivery customers demand real-time tracking of their deliveries in

to miniaturisation of electronic components they were introduced for civilian use in the 2000s since then many camera-based applications have appeared and turned drone applications into a 15bn global market in 2020 new wave of innovation the new eu regulation enables the creation of a new industry including the use of drones to transport goods drone that are currently operated by a pilot within its visual line of sight vlos are becoming automated and remotely operated beyond the visual line of sight bvlos new european vision the u-space concept in 2015 due to the high economic and societal potential that drones could deliver the european union decided to develop a vision for the safe integration of unmanned aircraft vehicles in the airspace it is this vision that gave birth to the concept of u-space u-space is a set of specific services and procedures designed to ensure safe and efficient access to the airspace to a large number of drones and which are based on high levels of digitalisation and automation in order to implement this vision 2 key regulations were adopted 2019 945 2019 947 adopted in march 2019 and implemented since january 2021 this regulation categorises drone operations and defines an adequate approval process for each operation based on a specific operations risk assessment sora 2021 664 2021 666 adopted in april 2021 and is being implemented since

trough of disillusionment due to a lack of legal framework without such a framework wide deployments of drone operations were not possible in complex environments present in most european countries the u-space framework will enable complex operations in more environments the global drone economy should grow from 15bn to 150bn by 2027 with transport as the most promising market equalling 55bn in
