follows an accelerated pace they ensure more and more critical functions in sensitive sectors such as aerospace automotive energy and defense they are gradually replacing metals they must match new requirements in terms of durability and recyclability their nature are increasingly heterogeneous their manufacturing processes become more and more complex 3 mastering their manufacturing processes becomes a major stake to guarantee their performances quickly deploy their innovations ---slide--- main problem at production level manufacturers of these materials collect a great quantity of data on a continuous basis on the parameters of the manufacturing process but practically no usable information on the inner quality of the manufactured product source major global automotive equipment supplier by increasing the consumption of raw materials production cycle time energy consumption scrap rate 86 of the top 100 european industrials concerned on a large scale data type qty process 3
