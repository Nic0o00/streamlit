a truly circular economy for the photovoltaic industry january 2022 the content of this presentation is proprietary and confidential information of rosi-solar it is not intended to be distributed to any third party without the written consent of rosi-solar key investment considerations the key technology to make pv truly circular a fast growing and predictable market a scalable differenciated business model a highly experienced management team a sustainable business plan 1 2 3 4 5 2 the poor lifecycle of photovoltaics 1 6 kg per 1 kg of silicon high-value silicon silver 100 loss silicon powder kerf 40 loss photovoltaic plants end-of-life pv modules natural resources metallurgic-grade silicon pv-grade silicon wafers panels coal wood 3 the key technology to make pv truly circular 80kg c02 per 1 kg of silicon in china rosi eliminates waste along the pv silicon value chain 1 technology applicable to end-of-life pv modules and kerf recycling making end-of-life recycling profitable creating a new source of 5n pure silicon for europe with proven industrial value chains compatibility paving the way to a low carbon pv 2 5 kg co2 per 1 kg silicon or 1 10 of today allowing for huge natural resources savings 1 kg module recycled 2 kg of co2 saved 4 the key technology to make pv truly circular end-of-life modules recycling made profitable value recovery of recyclable materials in end-of-life modules a proprietary end to end technology 1 5 the key technology to make pv truly circular all pv modules compatible soft non agressive process covered by 3 patents and 2 exclusive licenses first pillar the challenge of end-of-life pv recycling 2 market forecast based on pv modules already installed and that will inevitably reach their end-of-life from 1 million tons of accumulated pv modules to be collected and recycled across europe by 2025 to 10 million tons by 2050 containing 300 000 tons of high purity silicon by 2050 allowing to produce 75 gw of solar panels or 5 years of german silicon production annual end-of-life pv modules to be treated in europe tons year 6 a fast growing and predictable market second pillar recovery of lost value in wafer sawing 2 200 000 tons of silicon 1 5 bn value lost worldwide each year increase to 300 000 tons in 2030 80 of wafer manufacturing activity is located in china rosi technologies allow to recycle the wafer sawing liquid and to recondition the kerf as high-purity silicon to be reintegrated in the upstream value chain rosi focuses its commercial efforts on china the leading market second priority in rosi roadmap outlook at silicon kerf generation from 2020 to 2030 7 a fast growing and predictable market first priority pv modules from france and germany 27 europe the most regulated market weee directive france established and monopolistic collection system by soren a strongly regulated waste stream call for tender in 2021 secures an annual recycling volume to be treated 1 3 already secured by rosi with long term contract germany 50 of the european market 4x the french market in size other rules and players 2 8 a fast growing and predictable market outlook of end-of-life pv modules annual waste streams in
