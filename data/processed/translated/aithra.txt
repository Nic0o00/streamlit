ability to convert radioactivity into electricity to recover remaining energy from nuclear waste - best-known thermal conductivity 5 times greater than copper outperforms all heat exchangers and heat sinks in the energy and power electronics markets - enabler of a new generation of water purification for water leaving factories and hospitals - no current technology can control the shape of diamond parts which are either small stones small slabs or powders so it limits their possible uses - these shapes are extremely difficult to manufacture because diamond is the hardest material known - financial and environmental costs of diamonds are currently prohibitive - all shapes whether long wide convex or concave become possible enabling innovative uses -improved mechanical strength all other characteristics being equal -
