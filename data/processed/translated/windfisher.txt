Subsidized electricity with Diesel generators - Solar potential limited by latitude and clouds - isolated sites with restricted access - 4-6 months of insulation during the winter Wind Fisher - Airborne wind turbine for heating and electricity short duration - Diesel generator Group retained for a medium -East Industrial Industrial Industrial Energy - Solar and Diesel energy due to the lack of network - Storage of solar battery is too co -time - low winds prevent the use of conventional wind turbines Wind Fisher - Winds allow production in the afternoon and night - Simultaneous wind farm production allows you to load a battery for the start morning examples of use 23 airborne wind turbines
