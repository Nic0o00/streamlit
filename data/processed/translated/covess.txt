20 - covess manufacturing process current traditional manufacturing process traditional composite tanks struggle with suboptimal characteristics the process involves coating the carbon fibers with a liquid epoxy resin and applying it immediately to the liner where the epoxy reacts and cures this wet winding process leads to inconsistencies in the structure density is not constant everywhere this leads to a variation in the tank burst pressure of up to 15 in order to solve this more material is added to compensate which increases cost and weight additionally the manufacturing process is also slow covess innovative hot winding process consists in winding a thermoplastic polymer tape this tape is heated up causing the tape to melt after solidification a very efficient barrier is formed subsequently the layers with carbon fiber and a thermoplastic matrix are wound using the same process the tank produced this way then becomes vacuum resistant the gas barrier becomes homogenous over the entire wall and unlike type 4 tanks no gas entrapment is made possible between the different layers in contrast to type 4 vessels the use of a thermoplastic composite structure no longer requires an additional curing process which saves time type 5 tanks are manufactured through a highly efficient hot-winding production process which bounds two layers in one monolithic composite structure the process allows to manufacture 100 monolithic structures meaning the thermoplastic polymer is similar over the whole wall thickness in contrast to type 4 tanks the type 5 gas container differs from the current type 4 cng ngr gas containers by i higher internal volume capacity ii full recyclability iii explosion-proof even in case of fire iv better fatigue resistance and v less or no permeability inner barrier layer outer reinforced layer covess type 5 tank structure 3 2 the company -
