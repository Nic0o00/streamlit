soomiq presentation incl financials for finadvice for confidential use 7 november 2024 we recycle waste heat into clean power 2 executive summary werecyclewasteheat overview product presentation usp orc organic rankine cycle systems use special working media to generate electricity from low input temperatures this makes them suitable for generating electricity from waste heat the powerqube generates electricity from waste heat at a temperature of 100 to 200 c without requiring any other energy supply in addition to the waste heat thanks to a compact and cost-effective design and an innovative environmentally friendly working medium the electricity generation costs between 8 and 16 ct kwh only with an average amortization period of 3 2 years market description advantages there are 100 twh a of unused waste heat 100-200 c available in the eu uk which could generate 7 twh a of electricity the market for waste heat in the eu uk is worth 3 5 billion sam and us 18 3 billion worldwide tam while the global market for waste heat to electricity is worth over us 66 billion the powerqube has an output of 20kw it is therefore suitable for 90 of locations where waste heat is generated and is without competition in this market segment company capital requirements the core team of soomiq consists of stefan graber 30 years of experience in finance international business development and energy projects justin moldovan b eng process engineering and dr lingze wang sales cooperation asia legal our partners fraunhofer umsicht frintec deprag chemours k hner and others are

projektbesprechung powerqube how it works 5 the orc cycle starts the energy conversion of the exhaust gas exhaust air in a heat exchanger without a previous intermediate thermal circuit the working medium a fluid that is not harmful to ozone or the climate evaporates under the effect of heat and develops steam pressure the pressure is released via a gearless microturbine that drives an integrated generator that produces the electricity after expansion the steam enters a second heat exchanger the condenser which is cooled in an integrated way so that the steam liquefies alternatively an external cooling source can be used - and is fed back into the cycle as a working medium justin moldovan b eng process engineering soomiq our powerqube energy cube efficiently converts unused waste heat in the production process of smes and industry into electricity that can be immediately used again in the company - the optimal solution for many companies that have primarily lower waste heat

why we contacted soomiq according to one of our interested customers in the dried fruit processing sector our direct competitors have focused on the biomass sector with their 20 kw orcs and require a second liquid-based cycle the much larger industrial sector has not been tapped which opens up an excellent opportunity for soomiq with the direct use of industrial waste heat competition 8 conversion

key areas the paper industry dominates in scandinavia market part 2 waste heat between 100 and 200 degrees celsius has the greatest potential for waste heat recovery was determined by the niederrhein university of applied sciences in a short study published in october 2024 at higher temperatures waste heat recovery does not have the greatest user potential here the study primarily recommends heat recovery improved user behavior and electrification why doesn t soomiq focus on the market with higher waste heat temperatures and larger waste heat volumes 11 market part 3 90 of companies from almost all sectors such as metal processing chemicals brick and ceramic production food processing and paper production have smaller waste heat quantities and usually only operate 1 hardening drying oven steam boiler etc or 2 hardening drying oven paper machine etc with waste heat volumes for 1 or max 2 powerqubes with 20 kwel per furnace in which electricity is generated directly at the waste heat source which avoids heat losses and saves costs soomiq is the only supplier that recycles smaller amounts of waste heat of around 300 kw and lower temperatures from 110 c directly into electricity spread over several production halls only 10 of manufacturing companies have large amounts of waste heat such as large steel and aluminum plants or cement factories where the use of larger orc systems can pay off spread over several production halls large orc-plant and piped together which is technically complex with large quantities of waste heat it is often worth transporting the waste heat over longer distances e g through a heat pipe to a consumer such as a school or residential area so that electricity generation using orc is not economical orcan energy 50 150 kwel

large heat pumps equity investment of strategic investor or financial investor example jenbacher chp ge advent private equity initial public offering ipo normal operation soomiq s powerqube requires a waste heat output of approx 300 kw with as constant operation as possible problem fluctuating waste heat flows in some operations powerqube cannot be operated continuously at full load solution excess heat can be stored and released to the powerqube as required by using buffer tanks this enables the powerqube to be used even with discontinuous waste heat sources result the operating times of the powerqube in full-load operation are increased and energy losses are avoided through the combination with a buffer storage tank the powerqube continuously supplies 20 kw of electrical power even with discontinuous sources the storage of heat and electricity will become increasingly important and economical with flexible electricity contracts in the future hardware-focussed innovative climate tech
