shaping the sustainable transformation of the composite industry the first 100 recycled glass fiber products for advanced applications investor teaser january 2025 in partnership with ---slide--- strictly confidential 2 market the composite materials market is huge and increasingly crucial the market continues to exhibit stable growth driven by urbanisation renewable energy expansion and transportation demands all of which require durable high- performance composite parts high-quality glass fiber remains a critical component with 95 of composites being produced with glass fiber glass fibre production is energy intensive emitting 2-3 kg of co per kilogram produced in addition the composite industry faces a major challenge due to excessive waste of input materials particularly glass fibres current recycling methods for glass waste are limited to downcycling into low-value applications such as cement or insulation with most ending up in landfills or incinerators problem infinici transforms 100 recycled glass waste streams into a high-performance price- competitive alternative to conventional glass fibre materials this innovative approach can reduce greenhouse gas emissions of glass-fibre production by up to 95 embracing circular economy principles by integrating recycled materials offers a practical pathway to reduce waste and emissions solution glass fiber production a
