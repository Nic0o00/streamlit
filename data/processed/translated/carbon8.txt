creates construction materials capable of permanently locking carbon while concurrently provides ccus solution for hard-to-abate industries o reducing embodied carbon in construction materials is critical for the building and construction industry to achieve decarbonisation by 2050 tackling emissions in hard-to-abate industries under-addressed by traditiona l focus on coal and gas power plant emissions o cement energy from waste paper biomass and more verticals close to reaching commercialisation incl steel construction demolition and mine tailings o quick onboarding scalable solution tested with 120 residue types o stackable solution huge commercial potential from deployment of multiple containers per customer and per site 10k containers across europe and key target markets highest-quality carbon credits free from other debatable carbon sink methods instead offering circular value to construction industry and emitters compelling product proposition direct cost savings competitive cost of industrial waste treatment compared to landfilling carbon footprint reduction permanent capture and safe storage of co2 from point source quality end-products circular manufacturing of carbon negative alternative materials 2 distinctive technology advantage transforming the built environment into one of earth s greatest carbon sinks now capitalising on strong market tailwinds with advanced ccus commercial applications in hard-to-abate and construction industries award-winning technology goes beyond storage by capturing co2 at source and accelerating natural processes to give landfill-bound industrial residues a second life as high-performing construction materials acting as a permanent carbon sink o scalable manufacturing of circular end-products adaptable to client requirements concrete blocks ready-mix precast concrete pipe bedding road filler green roofing substrate fertiliser soil improver o 2 international patents granted across 17 countries 3 patents in draft for submission plug n play solution drives technology commercialisation and adoption by allowing for seamless integration and 100 automation o compact tech-integrated containers capture co2 directly from flue gas and treat residues produced on-site leader in developing best-in-class monitoring reporting and verification mrv methodology dnv approved o real-time measurement of carbon removal data for verification of high- integrity carbon credits exclusive access to proprietary data now commercial technology and production validated with leading international cement group vicat and energy group edf o 1st commercial deployment in 2020 for vicat a recognised credible leader and pioneer in the cement industry with 16 cement plants worldwide treating up to 12 000 tonnes of residues annually in the process with each container o current pipeline value of 40m 3 commercial offers with end-customers and 2 additional lois from offtakers currently in place 3
