and partners Thomas Oil engineer by training and founder of two successful companies and Jean-François specialist in the Internet of Objects surrounded themselves with a team with complementary skills to ensure the ambitions of Edge Technologies The founders seek to complete this team by recruiting a CEO or CMO and by specific profiles in order to develop the entire ecosystem Control of industrial processes and thus ensuring its international deployment The establishment of Edge Technologies en Provence has been done thanks to the Total Factory 4 0 factory program which offered to return to France to finalize their prototype intelligent sensors for ATEX approved industrial IoT When the founders arrived the founders met with Provence promotion which put them in relation to local partners who contributed to the development of neural networks and EDGE homeless safety keys also benefits from the Factory 4 0 Program of Technical Support by providing the industrial sites of MEDE and LACQ
