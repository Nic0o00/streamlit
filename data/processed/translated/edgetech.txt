complementary skills to ensure the ambitions of Edge Technologies The founders seek to complete this team by recruiting a CEO or CMO and by specific profiles in order to develop the entirety of its industrial processes control ecosystem and thus ensure its deployment to the International EDGE Technologies Provence was done thanks to the Total Factory 4 0 Factory program which offered to return to France to finalize their prototype intelligent sensors for the ATEX approved industrial IoT when the founders met the founders promoted which put them in touch with local partners who contributed to the development of neural networks and safety keys by roaming EDGE also benefits by the Factory 4 0 The provision of industrial and lacq industrial sites finally the solutions offered by Edge have been labeled Deep Tech by BPI France Market Asean Emea 33 America 12,000 SEVESO sites in Europe 2020 Process industry 1,075 billion 2023 TCAC 7 16 The market for industrial control systems had to reach 168,53 billion USD by 2026 and Cro Tre 01 This increase results from the implementation of industry 4 0 which introduces many changes in the operation of industrial processes to date 6 actors geographically distributed in the world dominate 90 of the global market share with the help of mergers and acquisitions and this to the detriment of change and technological evolution This market has a very strong technicality with demanding entry barriers on quality and environmental aspects 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 Edge Technologies Ma Trise its aspects thanks to the experience of the founder of over 10 years in the oil sector An international network among the largest specialized companies in the sector An increasing interest of industrial partners for the IoT-Based Process Automation and asset surveillance The founders wish an egalitarian positioning on the international market by starting in 2022 with the recruitment of employees for its deployment on the American continent Houston Our relocation strategy of our means of production responds to a logic of rationalization of logistics co -ts A better control of quality and the internalization of an activity deemed strategic in a growing sector customers Edge Technologies was able to deploy 100 sensors on site in France proof of concept in large accounts in order to measure the interest for its solutions seduced by these innovations 500 sensors have been ordered 2021 and 1000 other sensors will be deployed from the start of the year 2022 to date the orders on date represent more than 500 Key of turnover for only 3
