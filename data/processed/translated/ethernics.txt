decarbonisation of data centers pitch deck ethernetics in a nutshell who we are 10 978 data centers globally 2-4 of global electricity capacity 4 years capacity doubles 36 energy uses is non-productive digital servers are run by a global network of data center background adaption rate of ai applications is much faster than any other digital service while the energy consumption of an ai is 13 times higher than google search to become 30 times with new llm models source netscribes source joule digitalisation of our society streaming and ai increase electricity consumption in data
