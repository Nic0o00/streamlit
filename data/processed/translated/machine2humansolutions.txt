employees spend at least 30 minutes a day searching for information 54 would use service information for continuing education if it were not incorrect or difficult to find assuming average salary of service technicians in germany excluding opportunity costs when splitting above percentages of 15 service employees size according to employees of our customers insight-report service 2022 maschinenbau for example 49 8 of service employees lack step-by-step troubleshooting instructions 50 of the service employees search for information 30 min a day 27 search 1-2h and 12 4 search more than 2h assuming average salary of service technicians in germany without opportunity costs at 49 8 of 15 service employees size according to employees of our customers every 2nd at processing time 1 5h more than per year can be incurred due to inefficient processes as solution approaches have to be reproduced again and again reducing uncertainty and stress improving direct customer interaction providing knowledge immediately and taking care of troubleshooting our case and knowledge management solution supports service employees of machinery companies by reducing time to information improving accessibility of knowledge providing an answer to any questions specific to the company chatm2h supports all employees of machinery companies by our case management solution is based on speech ai and analyzes the service agent-customer conversation to automate processes case management automated ticketing case-related information is automatically extracted from a conversation and assigned to any crm ticket automated documentation the associated service documentation is automatically assigned to the corresponding ticket and saved knowledge management automated knowledge base with each service case additional information is added to our solution which automatically creates a knowledge base live assistance and prediction our solution identifies the problem while still in conversation with the customer- it shows the problem and presents the solution to the service employee our knowledge management solution additionally uses text ai from machine data etc to predictively present the solution approach for troubleshooting chatm2h knowledge for every employee the interactive assistant is available to internal employees as a supporting tool for example to answer technical questions tailored to individual requirements our company-specific llm is trained with proprietary data manuals processes customer service and maintenance reports chatm2h is a company-specific llm that is individually tailored to the needs and processes of the company our solution benefits from each service case each conversation is added to our solution so it can learn we train the ai further with all data available such as machine manuals instructions conversations etc we automatically generate a ticket with voice ai from a call between a service employee and a customer and handle the documentation for each crm our product guides the service employee through the problem live and in seconds with a dashboard case management knowledge management chat m2h based on the data already processed an llm tailored to the company is available to each employee the outputs are reproduced with clear references to sources of internal company documents click here for the demo video how our products work our products fit into the structures of the companies without any problems our usp s hands free no typing required no setup time immediate process r elief no additional effort use of already existing sources while other solutions require lengthy training our solution immediately automates important processes this saves time as well as costs and ensures more efficient work building common knowledge bases requires a lot of time effort and cost our solution uses those interactions that are already used anyway and turns them into a knowledge base without any effort our solution is based on voice ai which eliminates the need for manual text-based input this allows you to focus entirely on the customer which reduces errors single setup fee pricing pricing is based on recurring
