charging evs optimally 3 netzentwicklungsplan 4 eafo and own calculations cost of electricity jan sep 2022 in mwh we struggle to keep costs low renewables require flexibility storage global installed capacity accelerating towards 100 renewables we risk black outs we risk to waste a massive amount of energy in peak production demand needs to occur when renewables produce energy cheap storage is required e g for germany 200 gwh 1 evs have a big demand and battery evs additions are doubling yearly but their availability is not easily predicted and the interplay with other devices and the energy system is hard to manage charging at the wrong time intensifies the challenges they come with a frequently idle battery if all vehicles were electric the total available capacity for germany would be 2000 gwh 2 not green expensive without smart charging optimizing for costs correlates with optimizing for green energy when green energy is abundant prices drop and vice-versa regular tariffs don t reflect it yet and dynamic tariffs do but require optimization contributing to grid instability is penalized by grid operators unnecessary grid reinforcements are expensive 3 overall problem

vehicles charging cables in and out manually is not user friendly using software tools to plan charging manually is time intensive and is not reliable managing the control manually or via extra local controllers leads to more costs grid connection power is often limited and needs to be managed participating in energy markets is not easy coordinating local energy production building load charging infrastructure and energy systems is hard gathering the vehicle s and energy demand data from different systems requires hard it integration work building software and algorithms that consider all the complexities to process this data is hard rules of thumb predictions are suboptimal existing fleet other systems don t communicate with the charging systems vehicles data is not being used for energy
