technologies ur first building block is the most advanced battery management system on the market based on our 15 years of experience in the energy efficiency market and 3 years of ut our vision goes beyond that and with this first milestone secured we ambition to supply 10 of the global off-grid energy by 2030 e believe that large grids are inefficient due to their cost of construction and maintenance in addition to the electrical lines losses in a city like aris 11 500 wh are lost per year that s 16 of the city s total consumption o make clean energy the norm we bet on small to

energy market he managed the operations of an energy storage specialist for 15 years as then dlene enni - dlene is a maker at heart with high expertise of electronics and robotics with tens of hackathons and robotic contests under his belt e led regional prototyping for a fortune 500 tech security company for 2 years and the of an energy storage specialist for 4 years nvestment eck 2021

circuit are the main well-known- dangers that can lead to a battery failure or explosion damaging the equipment and causing immeasurable harm ut there are numerous causes that can lead to the same result aside the manufacturing defect and human error misusage is on the top goes beyond the usual- prediction and detection and can if given the rights- take control with no human s assistance to prevent this kind of situation elow you can see a 2 7 10 h pouch cell exploding in a thermal runaway event caused by over-charging o imagine what can cause an 48 2000 h battery or 10x 127 3000 h in a powerplant nvestment eck 2021 onfidential or solicited nvestors only 7 1 2 4 3 5 ---slide--- he first building block battery management system is traditionally either a 3rd party extra layer on the
