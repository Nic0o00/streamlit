hardware technologies our first building blocklightbms is the most advanced battery management system on the market based on our 15 years of experience in the energy efficiency market and 3 years of r d but our vision goes beyond that and with this first milestone secured we ambition to supply 10 of the global off-grid energy by 2030 we believe that large grids are inefficient due to their cost of construction and maintenance in addition to the electrical lines losses in a city like paris 11 500gwh are lost per year that s 16 of the city s total consumption to make clean energy the norm we bet on small to mid-size autonomous energy storage and supply units our vision the future is off-grid ctrl energy investment deck 2021 confidential for solicited investors only 4 ---slide--- experienced and complementary founding team before joining forces to build ctrl energy we are two friends with more than a decade of experience in the energy sector and more collaborating on various projects with high complementarity and mutual trust raouf remidan - ceo raouf is a serial entrepreneur with an extensive knowledge of international markets with a first venture created at the age of 14 he launched 9 venture in 7 regions with a deep expertise of the energy market he managed the operations of an energy storage specialist for 15 years as coo then ceo adlene denni - cto adlene is a maker at heart with high expertise of electronics and robotics with tens of hackathons and robotic contests under his belt he led regional prototyping for a fortune 500 tech security company for 2 years and the r d of an energy storage specialist for 4 years ctrl energy investment deck 2021 confidential for solicited investors only 5 ---slide--- safe batteries last longer batteries and moreover lithium batteries can react badly under drastic conditions overheating overcharging and cell short circuit are the main well-known- dangers that can lead to a battery failure or explosion damaging the equipment and causing immeasurable harm but there are numerous causes that can lead to the same result aside the manufacturing defect and human error misusage is on the toplight bms goes beyond the usual- prediction and detection and can if given the rights- take control with no human s assistance to prevent this kind of situation below you can see a 2 7v 10 ah pouch cell exploding in a thermal runaway event caused by over-charging so imagine what can cause an ev 48v 2000ah battery or 10x 127v 3000ah in a powerplantctrl energy investment deck 2021 confidential for solicited investors only 7 1 2 4 3

or a built-in by manufacturers card with protection capabilities in reality the management is only in the name we are changing this conception to introduce a new standardlight bms speaks human languagectrl energy investment deck 2021 confidential for solicited investors only 8 ---slide--- based on our experience and expertise of the energy storage and supply market we built a bms with no
