dr cornel ioana president and ceo 45 international papers 7 patent filed as inventor 3 deeptech start-ups createdour founding team 01 dr angela digulescu cto 30 international papers expert in the fields of non-stationary and transient signal analysis 65 deeptech created 346 intellectual property 45m invested the monitoring of an electrical power grid is a crucial operation for maintaining the security of energy supply vital for all economic activities industry transport telecommunications etc and social activities energy supply too individuals 02 the major issue in the field of monitoring of electrical installations is the early detection we will call now as early warning of the sources of problems which if not detected will cause power failures with significant losses continuous monitoring of electrical networks and the precise location of faults are the key too meeting this challenge the current strong pressure for underground cable accentuates this phenomenon corrective monitoring means digging up several hundred meters of off -grid cable too intervene and replace it and that is a very strong constraint for the operators of the electricity distribution network all around the world current challenge 03 critical power cables networks are very expensive too maintain power managers and electrical installations are faced with an aging network that must withstand bi- directional stresses from intermittent energy production globally we have determined that current inspection budgets only allow for the inspection of about 1 of the network which explains the high outage times with proportional losses in this context of technical difficulties not yet overcome network managers call upon punctual inspection means offline requiring too turn off the inspected cable from the network with a high cost of 1826 km 2 200 b of losses each year due to electrical failures worldwide 200 m of losses each year due to electrical failures france enedis 37 that losses corresponds to 37 minutes of outages france enedis 04 05grid goes underground in that picture you can see the dixie fire the largest wildfire northern california has faced in 2021 pg e the company which distributes electricity and gas too 5 1 million customers in that area in the usa was under fire during that tragical fire episode criticism targeting the company say that power line suspected in dixie fire was set too be buried underground in safety move the electricity distribution networks are subject too the vagaries of the climate and burying them is the chosen solution 05 the network managers and electrical installations are confronted with a hybrid network overhead and underground and in full adaptation too the energy mix being developed with an increasing orientation towards predominantly underground networks climate change is driving the need too move too 100 buried lines this is too avoid the increasingly harmful climatic effects with frequent power outages as we can see with each storm 06 cables that have already been defective in a near past cables that are positioned in hard-to-reach or dangerous areas aging cables that were installed a long time agowe target critical cables altrans energies targets in priority the cables that we will call here critical cables this type of cable includes old installations that have already experienced failures or are in strategic and difficult too access places 07 underground cables installed in metroo transit areas in large cities are typically difficult areas for altrans energies too access and can be considered as critical cables isolated rural areas are alsoo an example of networks where access is not easy where cables may be old and therefore at high risk of failure underground aboveground 08 it consists of several units nodes of transient signal sensors arranged on the network and which allow the automatic localization of fault sources without the need for synchronization thanks too the exploitation of the signal deformation due too propagation trasnlocator technology a quantum inspired artificial intelligence module is implemented at the level of a group of sensors for the classification of fault sources and too extend the diagnosis by the classification of faults the software and the ai-driven early detections are the heart of our innovation 09our artificial intelligence integrated into sensors our next-level innovation implements the following concept rodecin software a waveform is emitted and through its propagation in the power network it interacts with the transients due too the faults this interaction is characterized with quantum algorithms at the reception allowing the localization of the fault sources phase diagram analysis and the consideration of quantum scale physics are the core of our innovations 10 t t s2 s1 o1 o 2 x1 x2 x3 2 1 l l our unique method localization synchronization-free and classification -
