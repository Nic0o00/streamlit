Presentation Investors March 2022 A SOCIETE Reference for 10 years AUPRES ATTOPERS OF PETROLURAL STROLLY STROLLY STROLLY STRUCTURES OPERATORS with Total Shell Exxon BP MODEC AND SBM for maintenance and repair work on revolutionary technical oil -collage oil structures on steel allowing anchoring points to be fixed without resorting to traditional welding and without interrupting exploitation in explosive environments Very strong competitive advantage The competitive advantage of these cold bonding fixing techniques now interests the larger market in industry and the maintenance of large ships as well as that in full expension of wind turbines with its experience acquired in cold collage on Cold-Pad steel has developed a range of products to fix anchoring on concrete without having to perforate given the advantage of this non-invasive technique Concluded a partnership with EDF having to lead to an approval in 2022 of an anchoring product on concrete meeting the highest seismic criteria in order to apply these techniques to the maintenance and repair of nuclear power plants The transition from steel to the non -invasive anchoring technical fixing concrete to know without having to perforate the concrete or to carry out a point on the steel D 12 cm anchor in diameter that can support a traction of 1000 kg for steel and 500 kg for concrete The cold bonding of anchor points C-Claw anchor points on steel and c-block anchor points on concrete C-HAWK tool allowing to install the C-Claw and C-Block by reproducing the laboratory conditions on site in terms of Cold Shield SHIELD SHIP Total for the structural repair of steel shells and chemical tanks COLD-PAD products Fixing on steel No risk of explosion or fire and therefore no need to stop operating to carry out the anchoring work No deterioration of the paints or other coatings applied to steel, in particular the painting of ships of ship fixing on concrete no modification of the concrete structure In concrete without having to take into account the position of the irons of innovative products with different advantages The market on which the company is already well positioned is that of the maintenance and repair of oil structures The Maritime Market is a wider segment of 365 5 million euros thanks to the partnership with EDF The Company will also be referenced on the Nuclear and Electric Centrals market whose size is around 6 billion euros the most important market that the company aims by 2023 is that of the civil engineering of the maritime sites of major road and railway infrastructures and wind turbines This market corresponds to a demand of more than 10 billion euros The march and its opportunities currently the company develops turnkey solutions for referenced partners giving it access to a niche market given the competitive advantages that their products present and their products and Commercial potential on the larger markets in the construction of maintenance and repair The company has set itself the objective of industrializing its production in order to lower the price of the C-Claw for steel of 80 euros each to 6 euros and the C-Block fixation for concrete of 60 euros each at 6 euros this process of industrialization will extend over three years and will require an investment of the order of 7 million euros Round industrial solutions industrialization process lowering production of production co-tits COLD-PAD has signed a letter of interest with the Hilti Leader Group in the Distribution of Professional Tools A license agreement is being discussed the Company is continuing its contacts with other distributors of the same importance A distribution of products under license entrusted to the world leader in professional tools This lifting of funds to this process industrialization in addition to the support provided by the European Horizo program n 2024 The COLD-PAD funds was appointed winner of the European program Horizon 2024 The financial contribution linked to the Horizon 2024 program A subsidy of 2,5 million euros A subscription to a capital increase up to 2,5 million euros alongside private investors injecting the same amount for a total of 5 million euros per European program Horizon 2024 Key engineering services with high added values in advanced fields such as the petroleum or
