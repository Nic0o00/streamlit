Presentation Investors March 2022 --- SLIDE --- A SOCIETE Reference for 10 years to the operators of Petrolieres Structures Société referenced with Total Shell Exxon BP MODEC and SBM for maintenance and repair work on revolutionary technical oil-ending oil structures on steel allowing to fix anchoring without using traditional weld and without interrupting the exploitation in ATEX explosive environments --- Slide --- A very strong competitive advantage The competitive advantage of these cold bonding fixing techniques now interests the larger market in industry and maintenance of large ships as well as that in full expension of wind turbines --- Slide --- Fortful of its experience acquired in cold collage on Cold-Pad steel has developed a range of products Anchoring on concrete without having to perform it given the advantage of this non-invasive technique Cold-Pad concluded a partnership with EDF having to lead to an approval in 2022 of an anchoring product on concrete meeting the highest seismic criteria in order to apply these techniques to the maintenance and repair of nuclear power plants The passage of steel --- Slide --- Invasive anchor points, namely without having to puncture concrete or carry out welds on steel unequaled traction forces 12 cm in diameter anchor can withstand a traction of 1,000 kg for steel and 500 kg for concrete The cold collage of anchor points --- Slide --- C-Claw anchoring points on steel and C-Block anchor points Tool for installing C-Claw and C-Block by reproducing on-site laboratory conditions in terms of COLD SHIELD humidity specific product developed in partnership with Total for structural repair of steel shells and chemical tanks COLD-PAD --- SLIDE --- SLIDE --- Fixing on steel no risk of explosion or fire and therefore no need to stop operating the way Deterioration of paintings or other coatings applied on steel, in particular the painting of ships of ships fixing on concrete No modification of the concrete structure Possibility of fixing anchor points anywhere where on the concrete surface without having to take into account the position of the irons of innovative products with different advantages --- Slide --- The market on which the company is already well positioned is that of maintenance and repair of structures Oil The Maritime Market is a wider segment of 365 5 million euros thanks to the partnership with EDF The Company will also be referenced on the market for nuclear and electric power plants whose size is around 1,6 billion euros The most important market that the
