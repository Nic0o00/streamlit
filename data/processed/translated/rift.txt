decarbonizing industrial heat with iron fuel technology investor deck march 2024 strictly private and confidential ---slide--- currently 20 of global greenhouse gas emissions result from burning fossil fuels for industrial heat1 companies using industrial heat face increasing economic pressure to transition from fossil fuels to clean tech impacting their financial performance the urgent decarbonization challenge of industrial heat the challenge consequences of inaction 1 iea 29 of all energy consumption originates from industrial heat iea this is equivalent to 20 of all ghg-emissions co2 costs tangible financial burdens like those in the eu s emissions trading system green certificates industries face revenue losses due to consumer shifts toward carbon-free products or face increased costs to retain them non-compliance risks increasing financial and operational risks associated with evolving carbon standards page 1 ---slide--- to implement clean technologies successfully they must demonstrate both practical feasibility and cost- effectiveness compared to fossil fuels currently this poses a significant hurdle for industries over 90 of companies struggle to adopt a cleaner alternative as the current alternatives fall short on one or both criteria for example by 2030 an estimated 80 of companies will lack sufficient grid access to use hydrogen or electrification finding the sweet spot with practical feasibility and a cost-effective alternative seeking solutions urgent need for breakthroughs 1 based on market study conducted by rift available in the data room 2 based on data of euroheat 2019 https www euroheat org and sustained by our own interview results to accelerate decarbonization for industries it s imperative to introduce new alternatives that meet all the criteria being environmentally friendly practically feasible and economically competitive however limitations of current alternatives limited grid infrastructure permit challenges for boilers higher heat costs compared to fossil fuels at 1 5 kgh2 limited grid capacity not feasible in every case only cheaper when electricity price 0 04 kwh limited by grid capacity and rest heat availability applicable only in low heat processes only cheaper when 0 15 kwh dependent on the electricity grid limited by space requirements feasible only when electricity price 0 1 kwh hydrogen e-boiler heat

program page 4 ---slide--- in its simplest description we rust and unrust iron enabling the transport of energy over time and distance working principle iron fuel is stored and transported to an iron fuel boiler location with the initial batch made from scrap metal and sourced from the existing iron powder market the iron fuel is then supplied to the boiler initiating a self- sustaining flame generating carbon-free heat at 1500-2000 c the resulting rust is captured 4fe 3o2 2fe2o3 energy this process produces no carbon emissions providing heat in various forms such as water steam or hot air the rust is safely stored and transported via truck train or ship to an iron fuel production location within the production system the rust undergoes a conversion process into iron fuel using a hydrogen source multiple sources of hydrogen including by-product geological blue or green can be utilized fe2o3 3h2 3h2o 2fe the production process of iron fuel results in no emissions with the only byproduct being clean water 1 2 3 4 transport distance 20 to 10 000 km transport distance 20 to 10 000 km page 5 boasting a hydrogen to heat energy efficiency of up to 80 ---slide--- our initial focus
