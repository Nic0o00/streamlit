renewable but has quite some flaws ydropower is the giant of low-carbon electricity - t s currently larger than all other renewables combined - n equivalent of 20 000 is annually obtainable from our waterways rivers and canals - t currently has a 55 higher contribution to the energy mix than nuclear - t s systemically more flexible and secure - akes care of the base-load ydropower is a mature technology but typically with a high-ranging cost structure because it often involves large centralized projects - he largest cost being intensive civil works including earthworks tunnelling and dam and powerhouse construction - arge hydro has a tremendous ecological and social cost - ong lead times 5- 10 years o unlock more of the available ydropower a solution is needed to - ave access to sites
