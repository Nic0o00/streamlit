fossil fuels will cause second biggest absolute increase in co2 ever we are not investing enough to meet future energy needs to reach a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 a more than tripling of clean-energy investment by 2030 is needed markets are vulnerable to shocks and the intermittent nature of some renewable power fossil fuels satisfy 83 of primary-energy demand and this needs to fall towards zero as to battle climate change world energy outlook october 2021 international energy agency the economist october 16th-22nd 2021 don t expect big oil to fix the energy crunch ---slide--- 3 hydropower addresses the problems of intermittent supply with most renewable power the wind does not blow all of the time but water flows 24 7 the sun does not shine day and night ---slide--- 4 mega hydropower is a giant in renewable but has quite some flaws hydropower is the giant of low-carbon electricity - it s currently larger than all other renewables combined - an equivalent of 20 000 gw is annually obtainable from our waterways rivers and canals - it currently has a 55 higher contribution to the energy mix than nuclear - it s systemically more flexible and secure - takes care of the base-load hydropower is a mature technology but typically with a high-ranging cost structure because it often involves large centralized projects - the largest cost being intensive civil works including earthworks tunnelling and dam and powerhouse construction - large hydro has a tremendous ecological and social cost - long lead times 5- 10 years to unlock more of the available hydropower a solution is needed to - have access to sites nearby the end-users - limit costly and intensive civil works - be environmentally friendly to the nature and respect the ecological river flow - be socially responsible and don t replace people nor flood their fertile lands ---slide--- 5 low kwh zero-emission long lifespan empowering local economy collaboration with local contractors resilient infrastructure clean affordable energy for local communities renewable and distributed electricity fish-friendly so this is where the turbulent micro-turbine technology shines proven and patented technology trl9 with a focus on low head height difference 1 to 5 m and designed for low flow 1 to 10 m3 s or more if put in parallel short lead times 4 to 6 months off-grid turbulent turbines do replace dirty and dangerous diesel generators turbulent ensures the stability of the grid by supplying a base-load and preventing power shortages turbulent s technology is favorable for nature and biodiversity in contrast to large hydro turbulent keeps the costs low while at the same time its turbines are easily implemented turbulent creates jobs for local communities instead of displacing them or harming their fertile lands turbulent is committed to the sustainable development goals of the united nations continue to bring down poverty ---slide--- 6 turbulent has developed a compact and efficient turbine with a very low space footprint 1 football field of solar panels 450 kw solar 1 turbulent turbine of 70kw ---slide--- 7 turbulent reshapes the hydropower supply chain finding a suitable locations using our in-house geographical site location tool we use satellite data from nasa and esa to pinpoint potential sites for low head hydro site study and hydrology this tool also analyses the available flows and ensures confidence when choosing a design flow we output a bank-approved feasibility study turbine design our turbines are assembled from standard components with sheet metal blades the blades can be modified after installation in case the flows change due to climate change civil works construction turbulent turbines work with a free outflow and don t require extensive works below the water level this simplifies the construction and opens up protected sites for development turbine manufacturing turbulent turbines can be assembled locally and many of the metal parts can be made in the target country this way logistics are simplified import costs are reduced and a repair and maintenance team will be organized locally with the manufacturer ipp partners turbulent works together with ipp partners to develop energy generating projects close to end users our unparalleled low electricity cost the low visual impact and amount of noise makes for an excellent business case turbulent turbines replaces the off-grid dirty noisy unsafe expensive co2 emitting diesel generators achieving sustainability goals ---slide--- 8 click on the illustration to
