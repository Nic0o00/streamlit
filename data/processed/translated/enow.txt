principles of perfect competition The platform is unique in Belgium and we have not yet noted in the European Union of similar tools for category 1 Our priority target the basis of our business plan for professional consumers we will not talk about competition but a rejection of the solution by the Bureau d'Etudes which make the purchase of energy for their customers and Suppliers, which is not the case with non-commissioned design offices who consider E-Now as a tool to improve their performance and with whom we have started to establish partnerships for category 2 not recognized in business plan Price comparators could be considered as competitors, however, this competition decreases with the increase in consumption of small professionals our strategy is different from those of comparators since we establish a network Partners who benefit from customer confidence in their parta professional skills areas is an example and will offer its customers and starters the E-Now solution as it already offers leasing solutions with Athlon or insurance with P V 19 competitive advantages currently we have no concern compared to companies in place comparators and brokers
