power tools and now multiple modes of electrified transportation li-ion batteries have four principal components the anode - the cathode electrolyte and separator anodes makes up 25 of the cost of a

disrupt the global li-ion battery market ecell will enable li-ion batteries that are up to 1 3 lighter 1 3 smaller 1 3 cheaper and offer 30 -50 higher energy than the current industry standard ecell is different from other silicon anode technologies because it is produced from low-cost metallurgical grade silicon using a simple and scalable process to create an inexpensive drop-in replacement for graphite at a comparable cost per unit of capacity ecellix will succeed because we have disruptive patented technology addressing an extreme need developed by an exceptional team of scientists led by a highly experienced leadership team and guided by world-class advisors why are we excited about this one huge advantage of silicon si can yield more energy dense and faster charging batteries because it holds 10x as much li per mass as graphite two technical hurdles of silicon when si stores lithium it expands 3x causing cracking and loss of capacity when si contacts li and electrolyte
