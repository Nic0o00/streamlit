Our market in Europe currently more than 10 million tonnes of multi-component plastics are buried or incinerated each year our solution Producing technical parts from their customers from their complex plastic waste these products These products are recyclable in a new circular loop Our process is patented and allows you to sell at competitive prices versus other materials --- Slide --- Our target of the manufacture of two-dimensional boots.

On the treatment of complex plastic waste The markets targeted are present in all countries companies are increasingly under pressure to initiate the ecological transition on one side the financial sector is increasingly regulated on the other side Consumers give an increasing weight to the ecological criteria. Biodiversity, however, many companies are faced with waste that it can neither eliminate nor recycle, for example, masks and blouses in hospitals The refusals of production of packaging manufacturers The only solution becoming to pay to have them cremated or burying replace can then make a conditional offer in exchange to rid the business of these waste it will have to offer a guaranteed outlet to replace in particular by integrating the product Income Gate FEE FEE COSE CAPE COPE CO T ENERGY CO T DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE DE SALE REPLACES A MODEL WITH POSTAL REPLACE - Confidential - December 2021 --- Slide --- SWOT Analysis Replace Strengths - Real model of Circular Economy 100 Recycled 100 recyclable and 100 local - Abundance of raw materials whose only other outlets are incineration and discharge - Purchase price low including the price of transport and grinding conferring comfortable margins - the founding deix have a lot of experience in the industrial production of plastic - - Exclusive sales contract signed with AISA on the IPRA 250 machine without end date - Attractive partner for other companies that wish to improve their ecological image Weaknesses - Need to convince customers that this new product Press of plastic products partially extends to plastic products recycled and thus p Rodded does not automatically have the ecological image to which he claims - product that comes out of the standards in terms of rendering - need to adapt the recipe to locally present waste which complicates a rapid expansion - the BP assumes that 100 of the products will be sold if it is not the case the margins will be reduced and it will possibly have to invest in new molds the margins are also based on the expectation of any competition - Director R of Opportunities - The fight against plastic pollution of the Government leads to an increase in sorting and the prohibition of the discharge of waste of waste containing more than 30 plastic is added to it the theoretical objective of 100 of the plastic recycled in 2025 - Possibility of receiving a Gate Fee for the use of unwanted waste which will further reduce the cuts of raw material - the era of export of all waste, in apparently Completed the waste must be treated in France - it will be prohibited in France to destroy the unsold products of non -food products which comes into force between 01 2022 and 12 2023 depending on products - awareness and state programs aim to reduce or even eliminate non -recyclable to long -term plastics There is therefore a risk of shortage of virgin raw materials - Very distinct markets Agriculture Palettes Road signage Construction Public Layout It will be difficult for a small company to build expertise on each of them - in the event of a lower demand than expected on a certain replacement product will have to reinvest in molds and potentially adapt its recipes in order to change production -
