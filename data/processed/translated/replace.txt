Pressure to start the ecological transition on one side The financial sector is increasingly regulated on the other side Consumers give an increasing weight to the ecological criteria. The whole is framed by the State and the European Union, whether at ESG level or with concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or preserve biodiversity, however, many companies are confronted with waste that they can neither recycle Masks and blouses in hospitals The refusals of production of packaging manufacturers The only solution becoming to pay to make them incinerate or bury replacement can then make a parole in exchange for ridding the company of this waste it will have to offer a guaranteed outlet to replace in particular by integrating the product replaces in its own production income gate fee co ts de crusages capex co t.

Difficult for a small company to build expertise on each of them - in the event of a lower demand than expected on a certain replacement product will have to reinvest in molds and potentially adapt its revenues in order to change production - rise in power of alternative models of chemical recycling carbios future competition from major players in the recycling sector replace - confidential - December 2021 year 1 year 2 year 3 year 3 year 5 Year. 850,000 6,950,000 8,050,000 8,050,000 8,050,000 depreciation 481,250,000 2 3,56,250 3,362,500 4,368 750 net assets 3,368,750 5,600,000 5,693,750 4,687,500 3,681,2681,250 total active active assets 3,368 750 5,600,000 5,693,750 4,687,587 000 120,000 120,000 120,000 Customer receivables 168 300 882 657 1 379 174 1 424 347 1 424 347 TVA receivables 12 211 28 121 42 154 44 205 44 654 Treasury 1 063 989 1 037 748 4 044 534 6 461 079 10 149 Total Active Circulants 1 334 501 2 068 525 5 585 863 8 049 631 11 738 199 Total Active 4,703 251 7,668 525 11 279 613 12,737 131 15,419 Capital 1,570,000 1,570,000 1,570,000 1,570,000 1,570,000 accounts and results of reserves and results 876 855 2 367 2,888 804 9 313 160 Total Capital Capital 2,446 855 3 937 260 7 458 804 10 883 435 14 381 160 Loans and advances 1 922 500 3 221 250 2 667 917 1 385 417 510 417 417 DEBTS Suppliers 41 580 198 396 292 815 305 775 775 TV DEBT 21 780 90 194 810 197 732 Tax debt 270 536 221 183 677 047 -32 305 24 365 Total debts 2 256 396 3 731 266 3 820 808 1 853 697 1 038 289 Total passive 4 703 251 7 668 525 11 279 613 12 737 131 15 449 Note The balance sheets are calculated automatically from the information that you entered active active assets year 1 year 2 year 2 year 3 year 5 year BFR 207 151 534 794 323 538 22 484 -2 473 Investment 3,850,000 3,100,000 1,100,000 investment by supply in kind investment by credit lease reimbursement of loan bank 407 501 250 1,833 875,000 Reimbursement of current accounts Refundable Advances Refundable CAF Negative CAF Excluding subsidy 331 895 Total jobs 4,796,547 4,436 044 2,676,872 1 304,984,872,527 Founding capital 60,000 Capital Investors 1,510,000 Total accounts Total Current accounts 1,570,000 Bank loans CT 90,000 2,240,000 2,100,000,700,000 Lease credit Advances and loans Refundable subsidy 1,640,000 1,000,000 500,000 CAF Positive Excludes 1 359 155 4 027 795 4,430 880 4,503 976 debt IS 270 536 -49 352 455 863 -709 352 56,670 Total Resources 5,810,536 4,4 529 4 560 646 Excess period B - A 1 013 989 -26 241 3 006 787 2 416 545 3 688 119 Excess Start period 1 01 013 989 987 748 3 994 534 6 411 079 Exposed 1 013 989 987 748 3 994 534 6 411 079 Jobs noted the final plan ncement is calculated automatically from the information you have provided
