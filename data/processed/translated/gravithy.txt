bf which use coal as reducing agent resulting in high co2 emissions fexoy co - fe co2 this industrial process emits about 2 tons of co2 per ton of raw steel an eaf production using natural gas-based dri is more carbon efficient as it concentrates most emissions in the iron reduction process this industrial process emits about 1 ton of co2 per ton of raw steel it is possible to reduce iron ore using hydrogen instead of carbon in this case the waste gas produced is water as per the following reactions fexoy h2 - fe h2o steel producers will switch to eaf such near-zero co2 dri can be used as feed to these eafs and so enable the production of near zero carbon steel in principle the hydrogen-based reduction generates no carbon emissions however the subsequent processing in the eaf requires
