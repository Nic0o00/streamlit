to be around 12mw with an additional 11mw consented awarded under construction while wave energy is estimated to be at around 2mw with an additional 6 mw consented awarded under construction while these figures are still small compared to other renewable energy markets they represent a growing interest and investment in marine energy technologies and projects 2 the international renewable energy agency irena expects the global deployed sea ocean energy capacity to increase more than 100 x in the current decade reaching 70gw by 2030 and 300gw by 2050 180gw of wave and 120gw of tidal 3 conservative estimates suggest that wave energy alone could potentially meet 10 of global electricity demand tidal energy has the potential to generate approximately 800-1200 twh terawatt hours of electricity globally 4 in france and its overseas departments the ademe france s energy and environmental agency estimates a 3 - 5gw potential for tidal energy and a 10 - 15gw potential for wave energy 5 5 technological maturity levels of wave energy selected projects over europe wave tidal 1 137 44mw of existing projects over europe acceleration of technology the development of wave energy technology is accelerating with as much capacity added in the next 5 years as in the previous 11 years geographic diversification future projects will be spread across europe demonstrating the versatility of the technology and its numerous market opportunities this geographic expansion shows that wave energy can adapt to various marine environments which is promising for its large-scale adoption emergence of flagship projects several wave energy devices and at least two farms could be operational by 2028 including the 5mw irish farm by simply blue and esb and corpower s hiwave-5

overview around c 100mw in the portfolio ys focus on islands and coastal zones 6 ys has developed projects in various regions with a particular focus on two insular territories caribbean french polynesia through its subsidiary are uira french overseas territories offer a unique opportunity for ys as they are simultaneously resource-rich and have lcoe much higher than the ones found in the interconnected zones ranging from to 280 to 1000 mwh compared to its competitors ys is uniquely positioned to seize the opportunities unique know-how ys is the only pure-player developer for tidal and wave energy projects in france and its territories with its unique knowledge ys stands as a pioneer in rme solutions positioning itself at the forefront of a market that remains unsaturated and set for growth partnerships with local stakeholders by partnering up with local stakeholders for instance by providing auto-consumption solutions ys ensures projects are fully integrated to and accepted by the local communities flexible strategy ys analyses projects on a case-by-case basis and has an opportunistic view on when and if the shares of the projects will be sold be it during development construction or operation multi-technology and manufacturer approach ys is not tied to any a priori choices for the equipment mous and ndas in place with different manufacturers ensure that ys is able to explore the maximum potential for each site and be open to analyse sites its competitors cannot ys business an hollistic approach of development islands a favorable regulatory and local framework 1 renewable marine energy rme projects are gaining strong momentum in insular territories aiming to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels initiatives such as the emr cara be project which assesses the feasibility of marine technologies and the polynesia climate plan 2030 which defines an ambitious strategy for the energy transition of these territories have emerged these programs support the development of pilot projects such as twec 2 which would contribute to polynesia s goal of achieving 75 renewable energy in its energy mix with 20 coming from wave energy furthermore these projects offer three significant advantages over traditional renewable energies simpler and or shorter permitting approaches of one year for some of ys target geographies a production which is less variable and more predictable than other renewable energy sources almost no land issues only for the electrical substation there is also a strong interest from operators like edf sei or edt engie in such

investment highlights 1 strong portfolio and market potential ys current portfolio has a total potential of c 100mw targeting multiple markets with high growth opportunities including tidal and wave power projects 2 focus on energy autonomy by focusing on energy autonomy for coastal territories ys aims to reduce reliance on fossil fuels providing low-cost and stable electricity over the long term 3 leveraging eu funding for innovation active in eu-funded programs like interreg horizon and cetp ys can benefit from substantial financial support for innovation facilitating the development of marine energy projects with high potential 4 unique expertise for resilient solutions the company s unique expertise in multi-criteria data analysis territorial studies and a strong catalogue of technologies providers helps local actors create resilient long-term and cost-effective energy solutions 5 geographic diversification for stability with 37 already identified projects to enter pre-feasibility studies across france the caribbean and french polynesia ys reduces risk by diversifying geographically providing stability through various energy markets 6 alignment with eu

installed capacity of 64mw including 28mw in france and the caribbean and 36mw in french polynesia 2030 cumulated estimated revenue from electricity sale the estimated revenue generated by all installed projects in operation from 2027 to 2030 is around 135 million total net production a total net production of 172gwh year including 109gwh year in french polynesia and 63gwh year in france and the caribbean 2030 pipeline a pipeline of 23 installed projects including 15 in french polynesia 8 projects in the society islands archipelago and 7 projects in other archipelagos 6 projects in french mainland and 2 in the caribbean in addition to this a minimum of 40 new projects will arise between now and 2030 2030 regeneration pipeline considering the attractiveness and the increasing demand for electricity in the coming decades territories especially island territories will need production solutions considering also the maturity curves for wecs technologies during the next 5 years the unit capacities and efficiency are planned to progress this allows us to estimate our pipeline at 200mw that will be overviewed by 4 project developer managers for france and caribbean and 2

second or the third player of ocean energies market for the french mainland and possibly the first player for wave energy ---slide--- 3 geographies 3 strategies 2 companies ys and are uira adopt different approaches for each geography overseas territories island context france mainland context 9 the overseas territories have urgent energy needs this is explained by a combination of high dependence on fossil fuels a lack of available land and a low energy infrastructure resilience the consequence is a carbon-intensive high-lcoe energy mix ys in the caribbean and are uira in polynesia are uniquely positioned to solve this problem with an approach that is tailored to each geography mainland france has a relatively lower urgency compared to the overseas territories thanks to its already decarbonized energy mix although capacities must still meet increasing demand and adapt to changes in usage the french energy mix is decarbonizing prices are relatively low though volatile and there is a greater autonomy due to these characteristics for this geography ys will concentrate its efforts in the self- consumption autoconsommation projects a partnership-oriented approach in french polynesia french polynesia has the same political and administrative structure across the islands which results in a larger volume of projects and a greater industrial interest in the short term are uira aims at developping and building pilot projects such as the twec tahiti wave energy centre which is a demonstrator that will serve as a training center in the short-to-medium term are uira targets to become an energy producer in partnership with local polynesian stakeholders as polynesia is an island territory it is necessary to achieve a critical size of projects to be developed to attract supplier and epc contractors 1 a transfer-oriented approach in caribbean the caribbean islands are heterogeneous which favours a more opportunistic approach in which the assets developed or built by ys are eventually sold ys has already assessed the potential of these areas during with the interreg-caribbean program in the short term ys aims to develop and build a commercial pilot in the medium term ys wants to position itself as a developer for third-parties mainly for international caribbean 2 a developer-oriented approach in france mainland this strategy will require multiple local partnerships with risk-sharing via dedicated companies overall development is simpler even though the delays for permitting may be longer ys will take a medium-term approach for this geography seeking industrial partners and support from european programs 3 ---slide--- timeline contacts transaction schedule and contacts main steps and timeline of the operation 9 contacts interested shall send their
