low energy infrastructure resilience he consequence is a carbon-intensive high- energy mix s in the aribbean and re ira in olynesia are uniquely positioned to solve this problem with an approach that is tailored to each geography ainland rance has a relatively lower urgency compared to the overseas territories thanks to its already decarbonized energy mix although capacities must still meet increasing demand and adapt to changes in usage he rench energy mix is decarbonizing prices are relatively low though volatile and there is a greater autonomy ue to these characteristics for this geography s will concentrate its efforts in the self- consumption autoconsommation projects partnership-oriented approach in rench olynesia rench olynesia has the same political and administrative structure across the islands which results in a larger volume of projects and a greater industrial interest n the short term re ira aims at developping and building pilot projects such as the ahiti ave nergy entre which is a demonstrator that will serve as a training center n the short-to-medium term re ira targets to become an energy producer in partnership with local olynesian stakeholders s olynesia is an island territory it is necessary to achieve a critical size of projects to be developed to attract supplier and contractors 1 transfer-oriented approach in aribbean he aribbean islands are heterogeneous which favours a more opportunistic approach in which the assets developed or built by s are eventually sold s has already assessed the potential of these areas during with the - aribbean program n the short term s aims to develop and build a commercial pilot n the medium term s wants to position itself as a developer for third-parties mainly for international aribbean 2 developer-oriented approach in rance mainland his strategy will require multiple local partnerships with risk-sharing via dedicated companies verall development is simpler even though the delays for permitting may be longer s will take a medium-term approach for this geography seeking industrial partners and support from uropean programs 3 ---slide--- imeline ontacts ransaction schedule and
