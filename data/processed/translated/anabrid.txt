igital will come to a hard stop igital manycore architectures and high- performance clusters allow for progress ut the energy price for this is extreme t is foreseeable that the energy for necessary performance improvement cannot be raised uantum computing will not solve this problem either as it is even more energy intensive nly analag computing enables up to 100 000 times more energy-efficient computing ---slide--- econfigurable nalog omputer n-a-chip anabrid is the developer of the latest generation of superfast und energy efficient hybrid analog computers using intrinsic analog advantages of parallel data processing instead of sequential algorithms y hybridising both technologies we transform the powerful but inflexible analog computer into soft ware defined electronics his results in superior but affordable performance where all computational elements compute continously and simultaneously olution ---slide--- ybrid omputers for the uture he next generation of computers must enable resilient offline-first real- time calculations to meet energy and performance demands at a competitive price he digital front end and the open source software library allows for the first time in high performance analog computing fast and straight forward implementation of any application that will benefit from irst a runtime gain of at leat 1 000 while econd requiring 10 000 times less energy
