analog processing units buisness summary anabrid is the german deep-tech startup developing future general purpose analog computers g- pac as an alternative to quantum computers problem digital will come to a hard stop digital manycore architectures and high- performance clusters allow for progress but the energy price for this is extreme it is foreseeable that the energy for necessary performance improvement cannot be raised quantum computing will not solve this problem either as it is even more energy intensive only analag computing enables up to 100 000 times more energy-efficient computing a reconfigurable analog computer on-a-chip anabrid is the developer of the latest generation of superfast und energy efficient hybrid analog computers using intrinsic analog advantages of parallel data processing instead of sequential algorithms by hybridising both technologies we transform the powerful but inflexible analog computer into soft ware defined electronics this results in superior but affordable performance where all computational elements compute continously and simultaneously solution hybrid computers for the future the next generation of computers must enable resilient offline-first real- time calculations to meet energy and performance demands at a competitive price the digital front end and the open source software library allows for the first time in high performance analog computing fast and straight forward implementation of any application that will benefit from first a runtime gain of at leat 1 000 while second requiring 10 000 times less energy third analog computing provides a vast advantage in cyber attack resilience this is because analog circuits only serve the purpose they were designed for and are difficult and different to manipulate then digital processors solution 1 000 x faster 10 000 x less c0 analog vs digital source veritasium com analog gains traction solution in recent years analog computing gained traction as a future technology this picture shows a still frame from a youtube video from the veritasium science channel that got more then 10 million views it compares a traditional macbook with an anabrid product the analog thing decades in science and consulting founded in 2020 anabrid is based on groundbreaking research in contemporary analog computing team dr sven k ppel quantum physicist

energy and matureness for many applications such as ai there are no real alternatives the next nvidia ai traning with analog processing units machine learning training and interfering of large ai systems is incredibly expensive with contemporary digital systems such as nvidia tensor processing cards neuromorphic computers can help analog systems from anabrid are faster and more energy efficient in contrast to competitors we do not set on flash cells or in-memory computing instead we are cmos compatible and can be embedded into any existing digital processor in the world this makes analog circuits the perfect technology for demanding integrated systems for prediction and control in automotive aviation robotics medicine and much more value proposition key products clients anabrid is already selling discrete computers world-wide and now enters the semiconductor market prototype the analog thing sold 1000 units in 2022 on shop anabrid com anabrid now enters the semiconductor stage professional-grade de-facto quantum computer in development and ready in 2024 roadmap from discrete to integrated chip internationalisation we already sell world wide current targeted key clients anabrid has sold computers to more then 1 000 customers world wide in 2022 most of our clients were b2c and b2g currently our biggest customer is the german agency for aviation and space flight dlr within a call for future quantum computers our future clients will be chip manufacturers and industries buying cmos ip at foundry marketplaces the long term goal of anabrid is to sell ip instead of hardware see slide roadmap financing projections the bootstrapped startup closes 2022 with 2meur in sales with a cagr 25 intellectual property rights revenue and cagr enterprise value locations and team anabrid currently holds 3 patents in addition to 2 patents pending that will enhance the enterprise value based on the price paid for the transfer of ip by 20m the total enterprise value based on revenues and market capital is 40m as of now this results from earnings before taxes interests and depreciation and amortization ebitda and standard industry multiples 2x anabrid estimates a growing cagr of 25 over the next 5 years the revenue for 2022 amounts to 2m which anabrid expects to surpass in 2023 by at least 25 of this years revenue anabrid is located in germany with offices in berlin frankfurt and ulm at ulm we are part of the quantum innovation center of the dlr german aerospace center the company has 15 employees as of now and plans to grow to a team of 30 in 2024 value company key figures funding company and chip financing we currently raise 3m in order to produce a novel 65nm cmos analog processor ready to be deployed world wide series a anabrid gmbh was boostrapped clean cap table until 2023 we ramped up a buisness with selling discrete computers no own chips yet however this is not profitable enough at short timescales for building own microchips pre-seed seed in october 2023 we won a private buisness angel with a 600k seed invest we will run a 3m series a invest end of 2023 rough tooling costs 70 staff costs 20 tooling licenses 10 manufacturing costs 3m revenue projections we currently gain most sales with the redac computer reconfigurable discrete analog computer within the next years the successor of the analog thing that 2 0 will dominate our sales revenue projections given that we are currently in an active phase of product development the profit margin is thin and will broaden only within a few years profits are directly reinvested within the next years for future company growth the analog computer on-a- chip is a two year r d venture that ends in a product with discrete analog computers already selling we have unique launch conditions worldwide chip design prototyping and software development takes another six months chip testing and fabrication is scheduled for month 12 18 after start the finished chip is ready for product development after month 18 the long term goal is to license ip arm model and develop customer based special application chips to conquer roadmap timeline market competition our technology opens a new market at the intersection of existing ones market overview we will disrupt ai qc and ic markets artificial intelligence market there is concurrency in analog ai such as with mythicai semron or aspinity they are all limited to traditional deep learning approaches while we are the only one capable of doing nonlinear analog computing cmos quantum computing market the qc industry has the problem that particular approaches have long time to markets in constrast quantum inspired classical computing can already deliver today at a mature technology standard and very competetive hardware prices analog ic market big ic and mcu manufacturers do not recognize the value of software-defined reconfigurable analog electronics fpaas yet existing products as for instance from nxp do not scale and are not embedded in the right applications competitive landscape risk the technology works the only risk are successful sales the analog computer on-a- chip comes with little to no risk engineering risks have already been solved and it is purely a venture to finance the microchips and create lead customers in order to bring the break-even within short time we would like to mitigate this risk by finding a lighthouse account big customer from industry who is willing to sign a reasonably sized contract with sufficient upfront payment already during the development of the microchip products anabrid gmbh germany berlin frankfurt ulm hello anabrid com
