Ockerill had taken the leadership of the project was unfortunately ruled out by the Urope, although it brought a very competitive solution for the massive storage of electricity with a simple and completely safe process for the total recyclability environment of electrochemical equipment and liquids in the file presented to you was developed at the request of the heads of the Eraing test center and we would be happy to continue our collaboration with this team Performing Reception in the slide 25 We mentioned a need for 7 IO over 5 years Otre current proposal in a 1st stage would be a participation at the top of the 3 IO by Ndustrya necessary for the development of large dimensions prototypes in a future production unit in collaboration with the French subsidiaries of the Ohn Ockerill 28 --- Slide ---
