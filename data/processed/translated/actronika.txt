the leading provider of haptic technologies for reproduction of touch what is haptics kinesthetic simulating the weight or pressure of an object this type of feedback directly impacts the user s muscles haptic technologies transmit tactile information through sensations these can be divided into three types of feedback vibrotactile recreating vibrations created during an interaction to understand the nature of the surface or object with which we interact this is the haptics that actronika specializes in haptics is the science of touch thermal transmitting the sensation of different temperature ranges in the thermoreceptors found in the skin s dermis to produce thermal feedback problem solutions bene ts complexity in integration companies have to rely on too many partners to integrate haptics software hardware integration guidelines services licenses the players are too diverse haptic sensation are still a mystery for most companies limited immersion delity human machine interfaces are providing real or arti cial information to its users today these informations are relying only on vision and hearing classic haptic quality is poor today almost all haptic products are based on 1 frequency only meaning only 1 sensation truly immersive experiences and natural user interfaces are hindered by a lack of hd and accessible haptic solutions this document contains
