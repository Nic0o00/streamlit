report while more details are expected to be provided in their annual report when that is released https horisontenergi no wp-content uploads 2022 12 horisont-energi-q3-report-final pdf see p 9 compliant with elugie projects green e-methane from 2025 the technical screening criteria in the taxonomy for the activity 3 10 manufacture of hy drogen states that the lifecycle emissions for the hydrogen must be less than 3t co2e th2 here the technical screening criteria do not distinguish between green and blue hydrogen as long as the emissions are below the limit it could be that sometime in the future the lifecycle emission criteria will be tightened from the eu s side all taxonomy activities are subject to regular review and can be amended hence as of now both green and blue hydrogen can meet the criteria with the only extra criteria for blue hydrogen being that the co2 transport and storage activities 5 11 and 5 12 are also aligned the taxonomy activity manufacture of hydrogen also includes manufacture of hydrogen-based synthetic fuels where e-methane fit s in for the hydrogen-based synthetic fuels the substantial contribution criteria needed to comply with is life-cycle emissions savings of 70 relative to a fossil fuel comparator of 94g co2e mj the requirement for hydrogen to be aligned with the criteria for climate change mitigation is related to lifecycle emissions hence there is not a requirement that the co2 is stored underground to be aligned however the lifecycle emissions of the hydrogen or the hydrogen based synthetic fuel need to be below the limit hence the capturing process and the further use in the e-methane need to ensure that the lifecycle emissions are below the limit https www insideenergyandenvironment com 2022 01
