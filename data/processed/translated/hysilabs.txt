way of conceiving long distance transportation for the molecule is possible hsl solutions usp liquid state at standard conditions carbon free use of conventional liquid infrastructures no energy input for releasing the h2 suitable for on-board maritime applications hysilabs provides h2 to consumers together with partners of the value chain via hydrogen stored as liquids solutions after proving the concept at large scale hysilabs is ready to go onestep further and industrialise its process thanks to a 15m fundraising scalability will guide hysilabs to make revenues starting 2025 to access the mass market in 2027 and to break even in 2030 hysilabs has conceived the 1st way to transport and store h2 as any conventional liquid using the existing infrastructures and with a zero-carbon basis s
