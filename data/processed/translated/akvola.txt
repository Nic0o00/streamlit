engineering consultant akvola invented and patented microgas an energy efficient bubble generator to be used in industrial wastewater treatment several turn-key wastewater treatment plants using this advanced technology have been installed with blue-chip customers in 2019 with proof of concept and reference projects akvola started marketing microgas as a stand-alone product microgas can retrofit existing plants by replacing existing costly methods of bubble generation cost reductions result in a typical payback for the end- customer of 2 years even more competitive in new construction microgas technology selected in 2020 by global water intelligence leading market research firm in the water space as key challenger with a fast-growing total market of 1 8 b we expect to reach

hanging fruit bubble generators flotation oxygen transfer ozonation co2 transfer disinfection ozone is easily dissolved in water liquids using bubble generators to disinfect the water and break-down large molecules water treatment microbubbles slowly rise in water and easily attach to contaminants the impurities gather on the upper surface and can be skimmed off from the cleaned water in industrial sewage plants dissolved air flotation daf is the standard technology to create microbubbles for this flotation process thanks to lower opex at comparable capex microgas is extremely competitive and this segment is the preferred target market for akvola carbon capture bubble generators are used to better dissolve co2 in liquids as part of carbon capture processes hydroponics fish farming bubble generators create fine bubbles with a high specific surface area accelerating the dissolution of oxygen into the water used by fish and plant roots for breathing 3 microbubbles
