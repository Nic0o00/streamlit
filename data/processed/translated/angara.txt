when hex are clean and can recover energy at a maximum rate preheated oil gets to 250 c temperature heat exchangers array 20-30 hex recovers heat from already processed oil products by transferring some of the heat to oil 1 2 3 4 350 c is required for distillation oil gets heated most of the time hex are a fouled fouling counteracts efficient heat transfer b this results in heat recovery losses c additional heat must be produced to compensate for these losses thus more fossil is fuel burnt in furnace this leads to extra costs and co2 emissions 5 example hex clean hex fouled heat recovered by hex 250 c 190 c 60 c heat added by furnace 100 c 160 c 60 c more process requirement 350 c 350 c oil gets heated oil gets heated oil gets heated 20 c 20 c 250 c 250 c 250 c 250 c 250 c 100 c 350 c ---slide--- 5 however heat exchangers are still cleaned with age-old methods hydro blaster in the 1920s hydro blaster in 2023 the good old hydro blaster is still the main tool for removing fouling today ---slide--- 6 the status-quo cleaningroutineiscumbersome lengthy and requiresproductionshutdowns plan and bring specialized equipment dismantle and extract units load them onto a truck bring them to a dedicated zone cleaning yard yet mostly with manual hydro blasters or with automated hydro blasters clean with an ultrasonic bath do everything in reverse order install heat exchangers for 4-6 weeks resume production stop production run pressure tests several alternatives for fouling removal are available yet even the most advanced ones only marginally improve the overall process effectiveness as a result heat exchangers run fouled and therefore have lower efficiency for long periods of time between plant shutdowns the fouling removal part of the routine ---slide--- 2 minute overview video 7 our patented technology is ultra-fast clean-in-place so production never stops and efficiency can be restored at any time 1 2 oxygen bubbles fracture the fouling from inside mechanically with the pressure of expanding o2 breaking the solid structure our 3-step fouling fracturing technology replaces conventional 10-step routine with this simpler clean-in-place process 2 tailored recipe penetrates deep into the hard fouling structure and releases oxygen bubbles 3 fouling debris is washed away by the flow now we can restore the cleanliness and efficiency of heat exchangers 5-7 times faster with no disassembly anytime ---slide--- 8 an award winner of https techtour com events 2021 11 event-tech-tour-energy-2021 html pageid 5468624 named top 3 globally angara is un global compact member a regular speaker at the landmark industry events recognized as a finalist in rising star 2022 finalist our technology has been recognized by the industry and highly acclaimed by leading experts ---slide--- 9 we are changing the paradigm of heat exchanger maintenance angaraglobal com plant shutdown every 3 5 years cleaning only during turnaround average efficiency level time 25 50 75 100 heat transfer efficiency losses and co2emissions old way remove fouling -once every few years new way maintain continuous cleanliness decarbonization towards net zero our prescriptive ai analytics drives smart scheduling cleanings are driven by economics time 25 50 75 100 new efficiency level betterproductyields co2 abatement fuelsavings high-frequency cleanings thanks to fouling fracturing our prescriptive ai analytics determines when it makes sense to clean smart scheduling and fouling fracturing allows cleaning without shutting down the plant ---slide--- 10 we deliver our solution to clients with a scalable digitalized business model subscription technology license methodology support supervision cleaning contractor labor chemical producer angara cleaning contractor client digital flows physical flows in europe our supply chain and partner network are completely set up and our partners include well-established players of eur 500 mln revenue scale we focus on two things angara leverages the existing ecosystem of chemical producers and cleaning contractors 1 the organization of the whole solution delivery and 2 our in-house ai-powered digital tools to generate smart schedules and smart recipies ---slide--- 11 our main offering is a subscription-based turn-key service hex care offering we arrange for our clients the new level of continued cleanliness service of their existing equipment with our technology as the enabling foundation smart schedule driven by our prescriptive ai time 25 50 75 100 value we help our clients to bring their existing heat exchangers to a new efficiency level quickly and with no capex fast results within 12 months substantial impact 5-15 of co2 reduction risk-free -
