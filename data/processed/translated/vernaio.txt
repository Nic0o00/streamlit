cost of primary process rollout on all lines 8 control quality parameters in heated tobacco industry about our customer market leader in its sector scaling up their operations due to market demand double digit cagr growth vernaio s team closely collaborated with customer s data science team and process operator engineers during the conversion of tobacco l eaves into heated tobacco products various quality metrics were not consistently met by the customer s own efforts specifically moisture thickness and grammagewere not within their specified production limits this led to a significant impact on their operations overall and downstream processes as they scale up their operations process booster solved the issues it enabled significant improvements ensuring that all quality parameters were consistently met process booster was able to suggest optimal settings during the production to decrease waste from 4 to 1 30m in cost savings 110m extra margin process industry reference use case the problem our solution our impact vernaio com 9 preventing sheet breaks in papermaking 1 of 2 about our partner the voith group is a global market leader in key industry sectors turbo hydro and paper making machines voith sets global standards energy paper raw materials transport automotive disruptions in paper manufacturing are referred to as sheet breaks this is a known problem that voith and other companies have been trying to solve for decades the disruptions occur at any time and without warning once a disruption takes place a series of cleaning and retreading procedures were necessary before production could be resumed they estimated cost of sheet breaks and fiber losses is 1 125 000 per machine per year 1 5k cost per occurrence x 3 times per day on avg x 250 operating days per year vernaioo aivis ai engine solved this complex issue up to 87 costs per machine are reduced with aivis ai for an estimated savings of up too 979k per machine per year aivis ai engine decreased sheet breaks by up to 87 per day per machine within 60 min prior to incident occurring and on average 55 reduction per day estimated cost savings up to 979k per machine per year process

one of europe s largest steel makers producing a wide range of high-quality quality strip steel products for demanding markets such as construction automotive and machines in basic oxygen steelmaking bos the critical problem of slopping occurs when the foaming slag exceeds the height of the vessel and overflows this causes metal losses process disruptions environmental pollution and poses a threat to employees safety the factors that lead to slopping are quite complex even for experienced operators with process booster we enabled our customers to be proactive vs reactive utilizing our ai counter measures to prevent slopping events going forward vernaioo was not only able to solve the customer s problem but a major industry issue of slopping process booster increased ability to proactively identify and resolve slopping events by 54 9m in cost savings process industry assuming rollout on 5 lines production slowdown for countermeasure is 0 8 and 1 5t steel is lost during slopping event reference use case the problem our solution our impact vernaio com 12 avoiding disruptions in a bottle-filling line about our customer our customer is an internationally active manufacturer of filling and packaging systems for the beverage food and non- food industries the company employs around 5000 people and generates annual sales of more than 1 2 billion euros our customer had recurring lead machine-related problems in a bottle-filling plant they did not know what caused these disruptions and how to fix them therefore the goal was to analyze the raw production data of a bottling plant to 1 identify the top 5 malfunctioning machines with the top 5 malfunction causes for the lead machine 2 show the influencing variables on the malfunctions effective prediction and monitoring of disruptions with timely countermeasures identifying the actual causes of failure intrinsic failure at the inspector or at the washer due to overload or overhanging bottles immediate impact on production 1m of potential savings per bottle filling line per year process industry assuming a reduction from 12 to 8 in faults 30 decrease with a production capacity of 48k bottles per hour and 0 1 cost per unproduced bottle reference use case the problem our solution our impact vernaio com cognitive planning refers to the usage of ai powered production planning 13 improving on-time delivery in complex production planning about our customer the german company vacom is one of europe s leading component and measurement technology suppliers for vacuum applications their target markets include high-tech fields of analytics optics and semiconductors order planning must take into account a large number of variables capacities qualifications machine setup times and more this process is time-consuming and error- prone in addition these variables are dynamic and can change constantly our ai engine kayros makes production planning effortless post preliminary planning with sap tools by the customer kayros automatically optimized the entire detailed production plan thus kayros cognitive planning is ultimately responsible for machine allocation of the individual production orders kayros calculates a production plan including 28 000 work steps on 700 machines on a usual pc in less than 1 hour kayros was able to reduce production planning time by 50

fluctuations in composite parts about our customer voith composites specializes in carbon fiber-reinforced composites and has been recognized for innovation winning the jec innovation award for technologies like their automated voith roving applicator during the development of a new and complex carbon fiber composite product which is the first of its kind high quality fluctuations occurred between the different versions during production which stood in the way of market approval for the product the challenge was to identify the causes of the quality fluctuations from a large number of process parameters including still hidden correlations and explain them in such a way that fluctuations could be reduced to a minimum or at least below the threshold required for market approval
