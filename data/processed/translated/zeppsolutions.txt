weight efficient energy storage silent and vibration free operation - system complexity - infrastructure dependency well developed internal combustion engine basis no co2 emissions - still has nox emissions - less efficient energy conversion - higher opex - larger fuel storage requirement - infrastructure dependency no emissions ideal for light duty applications low system complexity simple low-cost infrastructure for single units - battery production requires rare earth resources - expensive charging infrastructure - linearly increasing system cost and mass for higher stored energy content - longer charging times zero-emission alternatives for mobile applications the problem is that batteries are big and heavy the more weight you re trying to move the more batteries you need to power the vehicle but the more batteries you use the more weight you add and the more power you need even with big breakthroughs in battery technology electric vehicles will probably never be a
