1 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential investor deck an outline of maana electric as a company its current business and the future of the company maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential august 2022 2 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential 2 maana electric is a deep tech company specialized in in situ resource utilisation isru technologies the company applies these technologies for the energy generation storage and space markets our goal is to power human ambition on earth and in the solar system 3 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential origin story 3 maana is a combination of the words maan which means moon in dutch and mana which means power in polynesian languages as well as being referenced in many other cultures this perfectly describes our origin story as maana was founded from the founders dreams and research into in situ resource utilization isru technologies for producing solar panels on the moon mars and beyond during their research the founders discovered that the technologies they were developing were not only applicable in space but also on earth where it could be used as an economically attractive environmentally friendly and flexible alternative to solar panel manufacturing what was only an idea in 2014 turned into a business in 2018 and has grown and flourished into a company with 50 employees 3 locations worldwide and a product ready for market 4 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential step 2 build solar capacity on the moon step 3 build solar capacity on mars and other celestial bodies our master plan build inexpensive solar capacity on earth step 1 how we plan to conquer the solar system 5 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential maana in a nutshell disrupting supply chains and the way in which we manufacture renewables maana electric uses its proprietary in situ resource utilization isru technologies originally developed for the space industry to produce solar panels directly from desert sand mining or construction waste streams this is done with our mobile and containerized terrabox system the terrabox fits in standard sized shipping containers and can be installed and removed from site eliminating supply chains in other words the terrabox is a moveable solar panel factory using locally available raw materials and electricity as its only inputs 50 employees 3 offices lux nl uae 4-5m in revenues in 2022 leader in isru technologies market in situ resource utilisation maana s current focus is on the commercialization industrialisation of its terrabox technologies for the terrestrial solar industry 6 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential let s talk solar 6 7 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential these issues lead to a global demand for changing how solar panels are produced problems in solar price are currently 40 higher than in 2020 due to energy prices regulations in china logistics it takes 9 months to 1 year from order to receival with 35-50 down payment required supply chain solar supply chain is fragile 80 of solar panels are produced in china high purity silica comes from only 5 mines emissions not so green as they seem pv production process has massive co2 emissions uses toxic non recycleable chemicals 8 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential yet sand hold a massive potential 8 9 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential solution the terrabox turning sand into solar panels 10mw of solar panels produced per year per terrabox 10 year lifetime 100mw produced per terrabox a mobile containerized solar panel factory able to produce solar panels using only sand and electricity 10 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential value proposition why customers want our solar panels low cost 30 less expensive than conventional panels on a watt basis 10 cleaner greener the greenest production process on the market 6x less co2 emissions no use of toxic chemicals no water waste locally produced 200 panels per day with a clear supply chain no complicated logistics meeting local product tender requirements control your own supply chain flexibility production as a service pay as you go vs advance orders same day replacement of faulty panels expand solar parks more rapidly 11 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential competition 12 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential 1 3 of the landmass on earth is desert ideal for isru solar panel production desert land 33 market beachhead markets with secured pilot projects medium term with clear interest long term with massive potential opportunities for waste stream isru mining construction maana s initial focus is on a few countries uae chile burkina faso south africa and spain where pilot projects have been secured allowing real world demonstration of the technology once in serial production maana intends to go global with first focus on economically attractive markets target market total addressable market the solar market is expected to be 568 billion in 2030 and 1 700 billion in 2050 with cagr of 10 the most significant growth areas are expected to be in desert countries 13 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential traction maana has secured 5 pilot projects across 4 continents for its terrabox technologies for up to 5mw of solar panels to be installed these early commitments show clear interest globally for our technologies and offer the ideal platform for testing the technology in different environmental conditions 14 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential go to market strategy 5m pre-payments for commercial projects with significant interest and the execution on pilot projects maana aims to secure prepayment commitments for 100mw of commercial solar projects around the world 2023 secure 5 secured pilot projects using the 1mw prototype terrabox maana will show the world what our technologies are capable of with 5 pilot projects secured today the company aims to undertake first solar projects and leverage this for securing larger commercial contracts 2023 execute 10mw using first commercial 10mw terrabox in 2024 we will complete the 1st 10mw terrabox and aim for construction of first commercial solar parks 2024 install 10 10mw terraboxes per month in 2025 we aim to ramp up production of 10mw terraboxes in order to produce 10 terraboxes per month and serve global markets with our isru production capability 2025 produce how maana intends to go from r d today to securing our market and getting to serial production 15 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential business model per watt on average our panels are 30 more cost effective than conventional panels offering the lowest lcoe on the market price is dependent on site volume region 0 2-0 3 per panel price per terrabox this is a non-refundable payment covering logistics and installation cost of a terrabox on the solar park site this also covers the regular maintenance costs required for a terrabox 100k installation cost per mw of panels due to high demand for maana s terraboxes we currently ask a 50k prepayment per mw pv planned installation in order to secure a slot in our pipeline this amounts to a 25 advance payment 50k pre-payment we sell solar panels not terraboxes customers pay for an installation cost and a price per panel is agreed due to demand a pre-payments on the to be delivered panels may be requested maana has an average profit margin of 70 per watt panel sold 16 maana electric sa powering human ambition private confidential

fund with its clear and significant potential to positively impact the planet by reducing co2 emissions allowing more solar parks to be deployed and offering energy independence to some remote or isolated regions maana electric sparked our immediate interest and attention noshaq is happy to support them and anticipates the collaboration with its industrial ecosystem consisting of technology development sensors equipment manufacturing assembly lines collaboration with r d centers and universities they support us why not you ending dependencies making renewables usable for less developed or secluded regions while simplifying technologies so much that they can be used by anyone and anywhere with nothing more than electricity and the locally available material those are key factors for realising a clean and sustainable future on earth and in outer space i am convinced that maana electric has the finger on the pulse and we at cce are happy to be part of it stefan lindtner cto cce
