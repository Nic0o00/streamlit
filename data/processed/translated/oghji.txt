Smart Switchboards for Planet Earth Pitch Deck Connected Digital Electrical Pun, Energy Savings for Smart Building Programs Surveillance and Optimization of Electrical Flows for Smart City Programs The Electricity Extension to the Digital Aire 2022 Energy demand will increase by 30 by 2040 Source IEA The European Union is set as an objective of improving energy of at least 32 5 by 2030 The building sector represents 44 of the energy consumed in France 11 of the electricity of the households is consumed by devices in Source ADEME The electrical panel strategically located at the CU ur of the electrical installation of the building has an enormous gold potential it is based on a technology of mechanical and magneto thermal circuit breakers 50 years which limits this potential but the technologies have evolved as well as the habits of a new Connected generation 1970 The objective of the project and to transform the electrical panel into a Smart Building and Smart City energy efficiency tool for this we will release the table with the constraint of its mechanical circuit breakers with digital technology and connectivity in order to be able to measure and act in a flexible and optimal way on all the circuits and the electric consumption of the Smart Building Protection Electrical Consumption In real time at the level of each alert circuit in the event of unusual consumption analysis and comparison reports comparison by periods design protection of the electrical installation in accordance with the regulations in force alerts in the event of anomalies Access to the list of events and anomalies cut in absence routine programming day night night preferences programming programs programs white day white day delestage of low priority circuits Minimum intuitive digital interface Distance access via mobile and web applications Instant notifications Integration of Multi-table management data management up to 20 energy savings for residential and 40 for the small tertiary the OGHJI solution Fine short-term rental rental co-living Coworking Coworking TeleTravail Repercussion of real co-ts and limitation of abuse End of life abnormal stop or faulty installation of home support for seniors alert in the event of a change of habit in daily electricity consumption My energy trise Stop heating or remote air conditioning after the departure of maintenance and troubleshooting tenants Your electrician is alerted in the event of an anomaly and can establish a remote diagnosis Smart Service The OGHJI Smart City Smart City Smart City Sensor. Big data thanks to the transmission of state and consumption data of each circuit for each building equipped with OGHJI while respecting the protection of personal data optimization of consumption modulation flows and electrical resources on the scale of the territory building Eco-district company thanks to the remote control of OGHJI and the sending of orders of erasure of low priority circuits in the event of high consumption CONSUMER CONSUM Hot water when local green energies are available Crisis management This mechanism can be reproduced on the energy supplier scale in the event of high tension on the network A flexible solution favoring renewable energies The OGHJI solution A solution all in one The existing solutions are disparate intelligent meter and communicating intelligent and controllable atmosphere. Consequent equipment is necessary if you want overall coverage and maximum efficiency electrical safety The traditional electrical tables are made up of circuit breakers which are based on thermal and magnetic devices to detect the anomalies overloads of current or short circuits and cut the circuits in default 24 modules for 8 circuits size of the box 375 x 355 x 103mm oghji is the first electrical panel As a complete energy management instrument responsible for residential and small tertiary service thanks to its OGHJI digital technology frees circuit breakers and natively incorporates all of the current sensors at the level of each circuit for a minimum footprint of specific algorithms make it possible to monitor the state of the network in real time and to cut the circuits in instant default the table is already assembled and calibration is dynamic Measurement features and consumption management are natively integrated into all of the circuits and thanks to its on -board software and its connectivity These features are scalable through a simple update Smart Home Energy Management Management The Electric Management Electrical Management The electrician must then add optional control modules to be able to measure and act on certain circuits. Consequent installation The electrician must assemble the table by choosing the adequate circuit breakers and calibrations according to their destination a modular solution which is installed as a classic table start box 8 circuits 1 control screen The extensions increase the number of available circuits The screen automatically detects all the circuits of the table The deportable screen can easily be integrated into a place of passage accessible at any time it will communicate with the s) s as close as possible to the electrical installation extension box 8 OGHJI circuits replaces the existing electrical panel It plugs between the general circuit breaker and the different electrical circuits 1 J install or I replace my existing electrical panel with the OGHJI table in accordance with standard NF C 15-100 2 I configure each of my circuits following the instructions of the integrated assistant.
