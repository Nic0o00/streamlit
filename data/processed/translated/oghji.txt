management functionalities A substantial equipment is necessary if you want overall coverage and maximum efficiency electrical safety The traditional electrical tables are composed of circuit breakers which lean on thermal and magnetic devices to detect the overloads of current or short circuits In default 24 modules for 8 circuits size of the box 375 x 355 x 103mm OGHJI is the first electrical panel that is positioned as a complete energy management instrument responsible for the residential and small tertiary service thanks to its OGHJI digital technology frees circuit breakers and natively incorporates all of the current sensors at the level of each circuit for a minimum size of specific algorithms allow you to monitor the state of the network in real time and to cut the circuits instantly The table is already assembled and the calibration is dynamic The measurement and consumption control features are natively integrated into all of the circuits and thanks to its on -board software and its connectivity These functionalities are evolving through a simple update of SMART HOME energy management devices The Electric management electrical management The electrician must then add optional control modules to be able to measure and act on certain circuits of all the circuits represents a substantial co-t and size installation The electrician must assemble the table
