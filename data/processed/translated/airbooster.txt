The aerothermal solution to combat climate change and reduce the energy bill The innovative low-carbon heating cladding 58 and 72 c 2 l winter during a sunny day when it is 10 C The temperature of the cladding sheet is between the solution The reliable aerothermal wall 50 years recyclable French product without organic organic compound Viewed transparency. Sunny while the outside temperature is only 8 5 C The air circulating in the channels heats up in contact with the sheet heated by the sun at 58 C The air thus warmed reheated 48 C then is sent inside the building at the rate of 130m3 h every 2 5m2 for a building of 1000m2 with a surface of 130m2 of aerothermal panels you get a thermal power of 78,000 WC Heating Winter Example 4 Exterior air inlets CTA Fan 8 5 C 8 5 C Temperature cladding T Burding 48 C Room Rorage R Booster If T Watering T temperature set 19 C 58 C Outdoor air inputs The Free Cooling The summer 5 L SUMMER The temperature regularly drops between 13 and 20 C even in the heat wave at a time of the night it is always colder. On the outside descends below that which is inside a probe controls the circulation of air and comes to refresh the temperature inside the building by injecting thousands of m3 h of fresh air free-cooling from 3 to 6 C by arriving in the morning, the air has been completely renewed several times the temperature is comfortable for the occupants and the start of air conditioning is delayed outdoor air.
