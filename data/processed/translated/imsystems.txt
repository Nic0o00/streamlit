the most versatile cost competitive and scalable robotics drive technology archimedes drive 2 the world should automate the half billion fte worth of dangerous dirty difficult manual labor jobs out there we ve only automated 1 3rd of what should be possible why has this not happened yet robots not yet good enough robot development programs are very expensive high-value low-mix jobs were the first to be automated remaining labor is much harder to automate automation is the future speed reducer drive issues are the main bottleneck for mass deployment of new robots automation has a problem it is now quicker to gestate a baby than secure a reduction gear from harmonic drive systems -financial times all effort goes through the speed reducer a robot s accuracy speed efficiency safety are all driven by the speed reducer speed reducers are already the most expensive part of the physical robot gears are the single most cost driving component of robot arms and if you are looking for lower cost one of the first spec features you have to let go of is backlash -jonas haulin global system architect abb robotics slow expensive lackluster performance cost performance supply chain expensive components and non-scalable manufacturing processes inherent to the incumbent design lack of required combined performance accuracy cycle speed torque weight ratio for high end mechanical applications

backlog 3 the robot speed reducer makes up 36 of material costs and governs the important performance indices of an industrial robot as far as the robot system is concerned the precision reducer business is the core profit center of the entire robot industry chain -erica li hsoar robotics 4 if you go on to the factory floor at any major robot builder you will see that 80 of the work being done is being done by humans this is a profound statement about how much further robots need to come before they are truly universal we make that jump possible but what is a speed reducer speed reducers turn high speed low torque electric motor power into the low speeds and high torques needed at each axis of industrial robots today the solution is a strain wave or cycloidal type reducer we replace those solutions axis 2 bends upper arm accuracy is key axis 1 pivots upper arm accuracy is key axis 3 bends lower arm weight accuracy balanced axis 4 rotates lower arm weight accuracy balanced axis 6 pivots tool weight is key axis 5 rotates tool weight is key 5 6 uses rollers not gear teeth to transmit power always smooth stiff and with zero backlash1 improving the controllability and accuracy x6 high gear ratio i e the reduction in speed and increase in torque enables lighter robots that can manage heavier weights 18 more payload unparalleled efficiency 95 due to minimal friction with rolling contact standard materials highly pure steel used to make bearings is available at low cost and high quantity individual parts have simple consistent shape profiles allowing for fast customization and flexible production lines for more responsive lead times simple production process developed from roller bearing production any bearing manufacturer already has sufficient capacity to make enough components for imsystems to supply every drive for the complete robotics industry technical advantages manufacturing advantages our patented invention is a unique traction-based speed reducer that provides performance improvements across the board 1backlash is the clearance between gear teeth needed to allow for free movement backlash allows the output of a drive to move slightly even if the input is held rigidly 7 the archimedes drive is the ultimate versatile solution addressing all key challenges in the industrial robotics market for every axis in any robot solution simple design many benefits balanced design for an optimal performance in all the axes of the robot robot engineers don t need to choose anymore sub-optimal performance easy to manufacture and scale by using simple steel hollow cylinders instead of gear teeth up to 50 cost reduction simple cylinder profiles mean customization does not require new tooling expensive complex and non- scalable short order delivery time and no dependency on japanese suppliers competing tech requires high mix low volume parts with minimal interchangeability non- responsive supply problem archimedes drive 8 what has imsystems proven internal external testing by mitsubishi shows that the archimedes drive has true zero backlash behavior and less than a quarter the lost motion of any other commercial drive accuracy ims has shown live demos at automatica operating at controlled accuracy with more than twice the speed of any operational robot speed imsystems has a dedicated lifetime test facility developed in cooperation with abb robotics we have shown longer life under harsher conditions than required by industry lifetime production cost analysis by linamar corporation shows that the archimedes drive can be produced for less than any existing alternative production cost the lost motion is small 6e-5rad so positioning accuracy can be improved that s very impressive -mattias medel cto harmonic drive
