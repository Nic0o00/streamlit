pioneers in carbon transition carbon is everywhere we solve two problems at once 1 2 oxylum s carbon conversion technology provides an alternative to carbon emission and taxation or the cost intensive storage of carbon thereby carbon emitting companies can combine the european union s ambitions with an economically interesting business case by converting co2 into chemical feedstocks oxylum can enable manufacturers to take the step towards the independence of their fossil based alternatives thereby reducing their own carbon footprints as well as the geopolitical liabilities attached to fossil fuels electrochemical co2 conversion cathode anode e- co2 o2 h2o e- hydrocarbons we only need co2 electricity and water for the production of chemical feedstocks intellectual property currently oxylum s technology is based on 6 years of research performed by the applied electrochemistry and catalysis research group from the university of antwerp through a license agreement with the university of antwerp oxylum can exploit both the novel and patented reactor design wo2021110824a1 as well as the know-how to manufacture state-of-the-art co2 electrolyzers in the future oxylum wants to maintain its technological advantage by performing r d projects both internally and with external partners i e knowledge institutes industry the goal of these projects is to generate additional intellectual property both on a reactor system and method level an aggressive ip strategy will allow us to distance ourselves from the competition 5 what can we make with co2 energy content normalised market value carbon monoxide formic acid ethanol ethylene methanol formic acid is the perfect beachhead market 1 it s low energy content meaning less energy needs to be put in co2 to convert it the high market value resulting in increased pro t margins liquid at room temperature thus easy storage and handling a wide range of potential sme clients divided across multiple industries 2 3 4 the formic acid market global formic acid market in 2021 volume share by application animal feed silage additives leather tanning textile dyeing and finishing intermediate in pharmaceuticals other applications e g cleaning products 1 5 bn cagr 4 2021 2031 1 5 bn 2 8 bn co2 utilization is hot proven market demand 60 of the investments were made pre-revenue new and upcoming market 76 ccu companies high market volume 36 billion tonnes of co2 per year not one player will be able to dominate the market investments made mostly in us and eu only few players compete in formic acid market we focus on sustainability not because we re environmentalists but because we are capitalists larry fink ceo blackrock unique selling points business plan oxylum will generate revenue through the use of its technology in a co2 conversion as a service business model we will provide a one stop solution for both co2 emitting companies as well as manufacturing companies in need of sustainable feedstocks the major drivers behind oxylum s business plan are the price of formic acid electricity costs and co2 pricing which are discussed in detail on the following pages development trajectory 2022 development prototype validation business case 2023 seed investment round 2 mio and start engineering pilot plant summer 2023 initiate process for environmental and construction permits 2024 installation of rst pilot plant modules and rst sales 50 000 2025 series a investment round 5 mio fall 2025 100 of pilot plant modules installed and operational bert de mot ceo co-founder bert has acquired a strong expertise in electrochemical co2 reduction during his phd sander neukermans quinten van avondt cto co-founder sander has a phd in electrocatalysis and works on further optimizing oxylum s technology business development quinten supports oxylum through his extensive experience in start-up s and knowledge of business management tom breugelmans scienti c advisor with his experience as full professor at elcat tom advises the scienti c trajectory of oxylum the team bert demot oxylum be sander neukermans oxylum be www oxylum com 32 487 78 05 83 bert 32 475 43 91 58 sander rodedreef 34 2970 schilde contact us now
