lab-grown diamonds powering the future of technology company presentation q4 2024 silicon is reaching its physical limits for high-performance computing some problems cannot be solved with classical computing sensors cannot detect critical variations in our body need for reliable navigation systems without satellite connection current high tech materials have reached their limits sic gan cannot operate up to thousand volts a lot of energy is lost due to the lack of efficiency of circuits power electronics quantum computing quantum sensing sensors do not last long enough in extreme environment sensors accuracy struggles when temperatures change quickly high-perf sensors 2 cvd growth process over a seed cvd growth process over a seed we are now able to consistently produce exceptionally high-quality diamonds using cvd process carbon source ch4 gas energy source electric plasma dopant source b2h6 or n2 gases x5-10 larger operating voltage vs gan x15 thermal conductivity vs silicon excellent quantum properties at room temperature x5 radiation hardness vs sapphire functionalized plain 3 there is a significant market opportunity enabled by our product portfolio source
